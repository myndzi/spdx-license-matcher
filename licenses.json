graphics application program interface \\(api\\)\\.the license is intended to offer terms similar to some standard general public licenses designed to foster open standards and unrestricted accessibility to source code\\. some of these licenses require that, as a condition of the license of the software, any derivative works \\(that is, new software which is a work containing the original program or a portion of it\\) must be available for general use, without restriction other than for a minor transfer fee, and that the source code for such derivative works must likewise be made available\\. the only restriction is that such derivative works must be subject to the same general public license terms as the original work\\. this 3dfx glide source code general public license differs from the standard licenses of this type in that it does not require the entire derivative work to be made available under the terms of this license nor is the recipient required to make available the source code for the entire derivative work\\. rather, the license is limited to only the identifiable portion of the derivative work that is derived from the licensed software\\. the precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\\. definitions 2\\.1 this license applies to any program \\(or other \"work\"\\) which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this 3dfx glide source code general public license\\. 2\\.2 the term \"program\" as used in this agreement refers to 3dfx\"s glide source code and object code and any derivative work\\. 2\\.3 \"derivative work\" means, for the purpose of the license, that portion of any work that contains the program or the identifiable portion of a work that is derived from the program, either verbatim or with modifications and\\/or translated into another language, and that performs 3d graphics api operations\\. it does not include any other portions of a work\\. 2\\.4 \"modifications of the program\" means any work, which includes a derivative work, and includes the whole of such work\\. 2\\.5 \"license\" means this 3dfx glide source code general public license\\. 2\\.6 the \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it\\. for an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, any associated interface definition files, and the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable work\\. 2\\.7 \"3dfx\" means 3dfx interactive, inc\\. licensed activities 3\\.1 copying \\- you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program\"s source code as you receive it, in any medium, subject to the provision of section 3\\.3 and provided also that: you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice \\(3dfx interactive, inc\\. 1999\\), a notice that recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the program can only do so subject to this license, and a disclaimer of warranty as set forth in section 5; keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty; and do not make any use of the glide trademark without the prior written permission of 3dfx, and give all recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program or instructions on how to easily receive a copy of this license\\. 3\\.2 modification of the program\\/derivative works \\- you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of it, and copy and distribute such modifications subject to the provisions of section 3\\.3 and provided that you also meet all of the following conditions: you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy of a derivative work an appropriate copyright notice, a notice that recipients who wish to copy, distribute or modify the derivative work can only do so subject to this license, and a disclaimer of warranty as set forth in section 5; keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty; and copyright give all recipients of the derivative work a copy of this license along with the derivative work or instructions on how to easily receive a copy of this license\\. you must cause the modified files of the derivative work to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change\\. you must cause any derivative work that you distribute or publish to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license\\. you do not make any use of the glide trademark without the prior written permission of 3dfx\\. if the derivative work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use, to print or display an announcement as follows: \" copyright 3dfx interactive, inc\\. 1999, this software is free and provided \"as is,\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied\\. there is no right to use the glide trademark without prior written permission of 3dfx interactive, inc\\. see the 3dfx glide general public license for a full text of the distribution and non\\-warranty provisions \\(request copy from info@3dfx\\.com\\)\\.\" the requirements of this section 3\\.2 do not apply to the modified work as a whole but only to the derivative work\\. it is not the intent of this license to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative works\\. 3\\.3 distribution all copies of the program or derivative works which are distributed must include in the file headers the following language verbatim: \"this software is subject to copyright protection and is offered only pursuant to the 3dfx glide general public license\\. there is no right to use the glide trademark without prior written

distribute the program or a derivative work in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 3\\.1 and 3\\.2 provided that you also do one of the following: accompany it with the complete corresponding machine\\-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of sections 3\\.1 and 3\\.2; or, accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine\\-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of sections 3\\.1 and 3\\.2 on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code\\. \\(this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with subsection 3\\.3\\(b\\)\\(2\\) above\\.\\) the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed \\(in either source or binary form\\) with the major components \\(compiler, kernel, and so on\\) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable code\\. if distribution of executable code or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code\\. each time you redistribute the program or any derivative work, the recipient automatically receives a license from 3dfx and successor licensors to copy, distribute or modify the program and derivative works subject to the terms and conditions of the license\\. you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\" exercise of the rights granted herein\\. you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license\\. you may not make any use of the glide trademark without the prior written permission of 3dfx\\. you may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the program or any derivative works except as expressly provided under this license\\. any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the program or any derivative works is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license\\. however, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\\. miscellaneous 4\\.1 acceptance of this license is voluntary\\. by using, modifying or distributing the program or any derivative work, you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the program or works based on it\\. nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the program or derivative works and doing so without acceptance of this license is in violation of the u\\.s\\. and international copyright laws\\. 4\\.2 if the distribution and\\/or use of the program or derivative works is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyright ed interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the program under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\\. in such case, this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license\\. 4\\.3 this license is to be construed according to the laws of the state of california and you consent to personal jurisdiction in the state of california in the event it is necessary to enforce the provisions of this license\\. no warranties 5\\.1 to the extent permitted by applicable law, there is no warranty for the program\\. or derivative works the copyright holders and\\/or other parties provide the program and any derivative works\"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program and any derivative work is with you\\. should the program or any derivative work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction\\. 5\\.2 in no event unless required by

you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program or derivative works \\(including but not limited to loss of

brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise, in relation to the licensed works\\. as a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any\\. for example, without limiting the foregoing disclaimers, if a third party patent license is required to allow recipient to distribute the licensed work, it is recipient\"s responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the licensed work\\. 2\\.4\\. reservation\\. nothing in this license shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyright s, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of initial contributor, subsequent contributor, or distributor except as expressly stated herein\\. distribution obligations\\. 3\\.1\\. distribution generally\\. a subsequent contributor shall make that subsequent contributor\"s subsequent work\\(s\\) available to the public via an electronic distribution mechanism for a period of at least twelve \\(12\\) months\\. the aforesaid twelve \\(12\\) month period shall begin within a reasonable time after the creation of the subsequent work and no later than sixty \\(60\\) days after first distribution of that subsequent contributor\"s subsequent work\\. all distributors must distribute the licensed work in accordance with the terms of the license, and must include a copy of this license \\(including without limitation exhibit a and the accompanying supplement file\\) with each copy of the licensed work distributed\\. in particular, this license must be prominently distributed with the licensed work in a file called \"license\\.txt\\.\" in addition, the license notice in part 5 of exhibit amust be included at the beginning of all source code files, and viewable to a user in any executable such that the license notice is reasonably brought to the attention of any party using the licensed work\\. 3\\.2\\. executable distributions of the licensed work\\. a distributor may choose to distribute the licensed work, or any portion thereof, in executable form \\(an \"executable distribution\"\\) to any third party, under the terms of section 2 of this license, provided the executable distribution is made available under and accompanied by a copy of this license, and provided at least one of the following conditions is fulfillled: the executable distribution must be accompanied by the source code for the licensed work making up the executable distribution, and the source code must be distributed on the same media as the executable distribution or using an electronic distribution mechanism; or the executable distribution must be accompanied with a written offer, valid for at least thirty six \\(36\\) months, to give any third party under the terms of this license, for a charge no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine\\-readable copy of the source code for the licensed work making up the executable distribution, to be available and distributed using an electronic distribution mechanism, and such executable distribution must remain available in source code form to any third party via the electronic distribution mechanism \\(or any replacement electronic distribution mechanism the particular distributor may reasonably need to turn to as a substitute\\) for said at least thirty six \\(36\\) months\\. for greater certainty, the above\\-noted requirements apply to any licensed work or portion thereof distributed to any third party in executable form, whether such distribution is made alone, in combination with a larger work or independent modules, or in some other combination\\. 3\\.3\\. source code distributions\\. when a distributor makes the licensed work, or any portion thereof, available to any person in source code form, it must be made available under this license and a copy of this license must be included with each copy of the source code, situated so that the copy of the license is conspicuously brought to the attention of that person\\. for greater clarification, this section 3\\.3 applies to all distribution of the licensed work in any source code form\\. a distributor may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, which charge shall be no more than the cost of physically performing source distribution\\. 3\\.4\\. required notices in source code\\. each subsequent contributor must ensure that the notice set out in part 5 of exhibit a is included in each file of the source code for each subsequent work originating from that particular subsequent contributor, if such notice is not already included in each such file\\. if it is not possible to put such notice in a particular source code file due to its structure, then the subsequent contributor must include such notice in a location \\(such as a relevant directory in which the file is stored\\) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice\\. 3\\.5\\. no distribution requirements for internally used modifications\\. notwithstanding sections 3\\.2, 3\\.3 and 3\\.4, recipient may, internally within its own corporation or organization use the licensed work, including the initial work and subsequent works, and make modifications for internal use within recipient\"s own corporation or organization \\(collectively, \"internal use modifications\"\\)\\. the recipient shall have no obligation to distribute, in either source code or executable form, any such internal use modifications made by recipient in the course of such internal use, except where required below in this section 3\\.5\\. all internal use modifications distributed to any person, whether or not a third party, shall be distributed pursuant to and be accompanied by the terms of this license\\. if the recipient chooses to distribute any such internal use modifications to any third party, then the recipient shall be deemed a subsequent contributor, and any such internal use modifications distributed to any third party shall be deemed a subsequent work originating from that subsequent contributor, and shall from the first such instance become part of the licensed work that must thereafter be distributed and made available to third parties in accordance with the terms of sections 3\\.1 to 3\\.4 inclusive\\. 3\\.6\\. independent modules\\. this license shall not apply to independent modules of any initial contributor, subsequent contributor, distributor or any recipient, and such independent modules may be licensed or made available under one or more separate license agreements\\. 3\\.7\\. larger works\\. any distributor or recipient may create or contribute to a larger work by combining any of the licensed work with other code not governed by the terms of this license, and may distribute the larger work as one or more products\\. however, in any such case, distributor or recipient \\(as the case may be\\) must make sure that the requirements of this license are fulfillled for the licensed work portion of the larger work\\. 3\\.8\\. description of distributed modifications\\. each subsequent contributor \\(including the initial contributor where the initial contributor also qualifies as a subsequent contributor\\) must cause each subsequent work created or contributed to by that subsequent contributor to contain a file documenting the changes, in accordance with the requirements ofpart 1 of the supplement file, that such subsequent contributor made in the creation or contribution to that subsequent work\\. if no supplement file exists or no requirements are set out in part 1 of the supplement file, then there are no requirements for subsequent contributors to document changes that they make resulting in subsequent works\\. the initial contributor may at any time introduce requirements or add to or change earlier requirements \\(in each case, the \"earlier description requirements\"\\) for documenting changes resulting in subsequent works by revising part 1 of each copy of the supplement file distributed by the initial contributor with future copies of the licensed work so that part 1 then contains new requirements \\(the \"new description requirements\"\\) for documenting such changes\\. any recipient receiving at any time any copy of an initial work or any subsequent work under a copy of this license \\(in each case, an \"earlier licensed copy\"\\) having the earlier description requirements may choose, with respect to each such earlier licensed copy, to comply with the earlier description requirements or the new description requirements\\. where a recipient chooses to comply with the new description requirements, that recipient will, when thereafter distributing any copies of any such earlier licensed copy, include a supplement file having a section entitled part 1 that contains a copy of the new description requirements\\. for greater certainty, the intent of part 1 of the supplement file is to provide a mechanism \\(if any\\) by which subsequent contributors must document changes that they make to the licensed work resulting in subsequent works\\. part 1 of any supplement file shall not be used to increase or reduce the scope of the license granted in article 2 of this license or in any other way increase or decrease the rights and obligations of any recipient, and shall at no time serve as the basis for terminating the license\\. further, a recipient can be required to correct and change its documentation procedures to comply with part 1 of the supplement file, but cannot be penalised with damages\\. part 1 of any supplement file is only binding on each recipient of any licensed work to the extent part 1 sets out the requirements for documenting changes to the initial work or any subsequent work\\. an example of a set of requirements for documenting changes and contributions made by subsequent contributor is set out in part 7 of exhibit a of this license\\. part 7 is a sample only and is not binding on recipients, unless \\(subject to the earlier paragraphs of this section 3\\.8\\) those are the requirements that the initial contributor includes in part 1 of the supplement file with the copies of the initial work distributed under this license\\. 3\\.9\\. use of distributor name\\. the name of a distributor may not be used by any other distributor to endorse or promote the licensed work or products derived from the licensed work, without prior written permission\\. 3\\.10\\. limited recognition of initial contributor\\. as a modest attribution to the initial contributor, in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the initial work, the initial contributor may include in part 2 of the supplement file a requirement that each time an executable program resulting from the initial work or any subsequent work, or a program dependent thereon, is launched or run, a prominent display of the initial contributor\"s attribution information must occur \\(the \"attribution information\"\\)\\. the attribution information must be included at the beginning of each source code file\\. for greater certainty, the initial contributor may specify in the supplement file that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable program resulting from the initial work or any subsequent work, but not a program dependent thereon\\. the intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the initial contributor may not require recipients to display, at any time, more than the following attribution information: \\(a\\) a copyright notice including the name of the initial contributor; \\(b\\) a word or one phrase \\(not exceeding 10 words\\); copyright one digital image or graphic provided with the initial work; and \\(d\\) a url \\(collectively, the \"attribution limits\"\\)\\. if no supplement file exists, or no attribution information is set out in part 2 of the supplement file, then there are no requirements for recipients to display any attribution information of the initial contributor\\. each recipient acknowledges that all trademarks, service marks and\\/or trade names contained withinpart 2 of the supplement file distributed with the licensed work are the exclusive property of the initial contributor and may only be used with the permission of the initial contributor, or under circumstances otherwise permitted by law, or as expressly set out in this license\\. 3\\.11\\. for greater certainty, any description or attribution provisions contained within a supplement file may only be used to specify the nature of the description or attribution requirements, as the case may be\\. any provision in a supplement file that otherwise purports to modify, vary, nullify or amend any right, obligation or representation contained herein shall be deemed void to that extent, and shall be of no force or effect\\. commercial use and indemnity\\. 4\\.1\\. commercial services\\. a recipient \\(\"commercial recipient\"\\) may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations \\(collectively, \"services\"\\) to one or more other recipients or distributors\\. however, such commercial recipient may do so only on that commercial recipient\"s own behalf, and not on behalf of any other distributor or recipient, and commercial recipient must make it clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation\\(s\\) is\\/are offered by commercial recipient alone\\. at no time may commercial recipient use any services to deny any party the licensed work in source code or executable form when so required under any of the other terms of this license\\. for greater certainty, this section 4\\.1 does not diminish any of the other terms of this license, including without limitation the obligation of the commercial recipient as a distributor, when distributing any of the licensed work in source code or executable form, to make such distribution royalty\\-free \\(subject to the right to charge a fee of no more than the cost of physically performing source code or executable distribution \\(as the case may be\\)\\)\\. 4\\.2\\. indemnity\\. commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like\\. while this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the licensed work, the distributor who includes any of the licensed work in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other distributors\\. therefore, if a distributor includes the licensed work in a commercial product offering or offers any services, such distributor \\(\"commercial distributor\"\\) hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other distributor or subsequent contributor \\(in each case an \"indemnified party\"\\) against any losses, damages and costs \\(collectively \"losses\"\\) arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the indemnified party to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such commercial distributor in connection with its distribution of any of the licensed work in a commercial product offering or in connection with any services\\. the obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement\\. in order to qualify, an indemnified party must: \\(a\\) promptly notify the commercial distributor in writing of such claim; and \\(b\\) allow the commercial distributor to control, and co\\-operate with the commercial distributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations\\. the indemnified party may participate in any such claim at its own expense\\. versions of the license\\. 5\\.1\\. new versions\\. the initial contributor may publish revised and\\/or new versions of the license from time to time\\. each version will

license, recipient may choose to continue to use it under the terms of that version\\. however, if a recipient chooses to use the licensed work under the terms of any subsequent version of the license published by the initial contributor, then from the date of making this choice, the recipient must comply with the terms of that subsequent version with respect to all further reproduction, preparation of derivative works, public display of, public performance of, distribution and sublicensing by the recipient in connection with the licensed work\\. no one other than the initial

material breach by such recipient of any term of any other license under which such recipient is granted any rights to the licensed work shall constitute a material breach of this license\\. 7\\.4\\.

sublicenses to the licensed work which were previously properly granted by such recipient under a copy of this license \\(in each case, an \"other license\" and in plural, \"other licenses\"\\) shall

License v1.0","identifier":"AGPL-1.0","url":["http://www.affero.org/oagpl.html"],"header":"","template":"version 1, march 2002 copyright 2002 affero inc\\. 510 third street \\- suite 225, san francisco, ca 94107, usa this license is a modified version of the gnu general public license copyright 1989, 1991 free software foundation, inc\\. made with their permission\\. section 2\\(d\\) has been added to cover use of software over a computer network\\. everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed\\. preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it\\. by contrast, the affero general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software\\-\\-to make sure the software is free for all its users\\. this public license applies to most of affero\"s software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it\\. \\(some other affero software is covered by the gnu library general public license instead\\.\\) you can apply it to your programs, too\\. when we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price\\. this general public license is designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software \\(and charge for this service if you wish\\), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things\\. to protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights\\. these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it\\. for example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have\\. you must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\\. and you must show them these terms so they know their rights\\. we protect your rights with two steps: \\(1\\) copyright the software, and \\(2\\) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\\/or modify the software\\. also, for each author\"s protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software\\. if the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\" reputations\\. finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents\\. we wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary\\. to prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\"s free use or not licensed at all\\. the precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\\. terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification this license applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this affero general public license\\. the \"program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the program\" means either the program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\\/or translated into another language\\. \\(hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\"\\.\\) each licensee is addressed as \"you\"\\. activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope\\. the act of running the program is not restricted, and the output from the program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the program \\(independent of having been made by running the program\\)\\. whether that is true depends on what the program does\\. you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the program\"s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the program a copy of this license along with the program\\. you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\\. you may modify your copy or copies of the program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: you must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change\\. you must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license\\. if the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty \\(or else, saying that you provide a warranty\\) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this license\\. \\(exception: if the program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the program is not required to print an announcement\\.\\) if the program as you received it is intended to interact with users through a computer network and if, in the version you received, any user interacting with the program was given the opportunity to request transmission to that user of the program\"s complete source code, you must not remove that facility from your modified version of the program or work based on the program, and must offer an equivalent opportunity for all users interacting with your program through a computer network to request immediate transmission by http of the complete source code of your modified version or other derivative work\\. these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole\\. if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this license, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works\\. but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it\\. thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the program\\. in addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the program with the program \\(or with a work based on the program\\) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license\\. you may copy and distribute the program \\(or a work based on it, under section 2\\) in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: accompany it with the complete corresponding machine\\-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine\\-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code\\. \\(this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with subsection b above\\.\\) the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it\\. for an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable\\. however, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed \\(in either source or binary form\\) with the major components \\(compiler, kernel, and so on\\) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable\\. if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code\\. you may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the program except as expressly provided under this license\\. any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license\\. however, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\\. you are not required to accept this license, since you have not signed it\\. however, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the program or its derivative works\\. these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license\\. therefore, by modifying or distributing the program \\(or any work based on the program\\), you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the program or works based on it\\. each time you redistribute the program \\(or any work based on the program\\), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the program subject to these terms and conditions\\. you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\" exercise of the rights granted herein\\. you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license\\. if, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason \\(not limited to patent issues\\), conditions are imposed on you \\(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise\\) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license\\. if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the program at all\\. for example, if a patent license would not permit royalty\\-free redistribution of the program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the program\\. if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances\\. it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices\\. many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\\. this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license\\. if the distribution and\\/or use of the program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyright ed interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the program under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\\. in such case, this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license\\. affero inc\\. may publish revised and\\/or new versions of the affero general public license from time to time\\. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns\\. each version is given a distinguishing version number\\. if the program specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by affero, inc\\. if the program does not specify a version number of this license, you may choose any version ever published by affero, inc\\. you may also choose to redistribute modified versions of this program under any version of the free software foundation\"s gnu general public license version 3 or higher, so long as that version of the gnu gpl includes terms and conditions substantially equivalent to those of this license\\. if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission\\. for software which is copyright ed by affero, inc\\., write to us; we sometimes make exceptions for this\\. our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally\\. no warranty because the program is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law\\. except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and\\/or other parties provide the program \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you\\. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction\\. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and\\/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program \\(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs\\), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"Afmparse

provided that you comply with all of the restrictions set forth in this license and provided, further, that you distribute an unmodified copy of this license with the program: you may copy and distribute literal \\(i\\.e\\., verbatim\\) copies of the program\"s source code as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium\\. you may modify the program, create works based on the program and distribute copies of such throughout the world, in any medium\\. restrictions\\. this license is subject to the following restrictions: distribution of the program or any work based on the program by a commercial organization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is made in connection with such distribution, whether directly \\(as in payment for a copy of the program\\) or indirectly \\(as in payment for some service related to the program, or payment for some product or service that includes a copy of the program \"without charge\"; these are only examples, and not an exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities\\)\\. the following methods of distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation of this restriction: posting the program on a public access information storage and retrieval service for which a fee is received for retrieving information \\(such as an on\\-line service\\), provided that the fee is not content\\-dependent \\(i\\.e\\., the fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of information consisting of random data\\) and that access to the service and to the program is available independent of any other product or service\\. an example of a service that does not fall under this section is an on\\-line service that is operated by a company and that is only available to customers of that company\\. \\(this is not an exhaustive enumeration\\.\\) distributing the program on removable computer\\-readable media, provided that the files containing the program are reproduced entirely and verbatim on such media, that all information on such media be redistributable for noncommercial purposes without charge, and that such media are distributed by themselves \\(except for accompanying documentation\\) independent of any other product or service\\. examples of such media include cd\\-rom, magnetic tape, and optical storage media\\. \\(this is not intended to be an exhaustive list\\.\\) an example of a distribution that does not fall under this section is a cd\\-rom included in a book or magazine\\. \\(this is not an exhaustive enumeration\\.\\) activities other than copying, distribution and modification of the program are not subject to this license and they are outside its scope\\. functional use \\(running\\) of the program is not restricted, and any output produced through the use of the program is subject to this license only if its contents constitute a work based on the program \\(independent of having been made by running the program\\)\\. you must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the program or any part thereof \\(\"the work\"\\): if you have modified the program, you must cause the work to carry prominent notices stating that you have modified the program\"s files and the date of any change\\. in each source file that you have modified, you must include a prominent notice that you have modified the file, including your name, your e\\-mail address \\(if any\\), and the date and purpose of the change; you must cause the work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license; if the work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, at each time the work commences operation, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty \\(or else, saying that you provide a warranty\\)\\. such notice must also state that users may redistribute the work only under the conditions of this license and tell the user how to view the copy of this license included with the work\\. \\(exceptions: if the program is interactive but normally prints or displays such an announcement only at the request of a user, such as in an \"about box\", the work is required to print or display the notice only under the same circumstances; if the program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, the work is not required to print an announcement\\.\\); you must accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine\\-readable source code, delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange\\. the source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it\\. for an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable code\\. if you distribute with the work any component that is normally distributed \\(in either source or binary form\\) with the major components \\(compiler, kernel, and so on\\) of the operating system on which the executable runs, you must also distribute the source code of that component if you have it and are allowed to do so; if you distribute any written or printed material at all with the work, such material must include either a written copy of this license, or a prominent written indication that the work is covered by this license and written instructions for printing and\\/or displaying the copy of the license on the distribution medium; you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient\"s exercise of the rights granted herein\\. if distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the equivalent ability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source code along with the object code\\. reservation of rights\\. no rights are granted to the program except as expressly set forth herein\\. you may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the program except as expressly provided under this license\\. any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license\\. however, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\\. other restrictions\\. if the distribution and\\/or use of the program is restricted in certain countries for any reason, licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\\. in such case, this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license\\. limitations\\. the program is provided to you \"as is,\" without warranty\\. there is no warranty for the program, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement of third party rights\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you\\. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction\\. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will licensor, or any other party who may modify and\\/or redistribute the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program \\(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs\\), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\. general\\. this license is governed by the laws of the state of california, u\\.s\\.a\\., excluding choice of law rules\\. if any part of this license is found to be in conflict with the law, that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law, and no other parts of the license shall be affected\\. for united states government users, the program is provided with restricted rights\\. if you are a unit or agency of the united states government or are acquiring the program for any such unit or agency, the following apply: if the unit or agency is the department of defense \\(\"dod\"\\), the program and its documentation are classified as \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation\" respectively and, pursuant to dfar section 227\\.7202, the government is acquiring the program and its documentation in accordance with the terms of this license\\. if the unit or agency is other than dod, the program and its documentation are classified as \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation\" respectively and, pursuant to far section 12\\.212, the government is acquiring the

properly granted shall survive any termination of this license so long as they continue to complye with the terms of this license\\. provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this license, shall survive\\. termination upon assertion of patent infringement\\. if you initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim \\(excluding declaratory judgement actions\\) against licensor or a contributor \\(licensor or contributor against whom you file such an action is referred to herein as respondent\\) alleging that licensed product directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such respondent to you under sections 1 or 2 of this license shall terminate prospectively upon sixty \\(60\\) days notice from respondent \\(the \"notice period\"\\) unless within that notice period you either agree in writing \\(i\\) to pay respondent a mutually agreeable reasonably royalty for your past or future use of licensed product made by such respondent, or \\(ii\\) withdraw your litigation claim with respect to licensed product against such respondent\\. if within said notice period a reasonable royalty and

terminate at the expiration of said notice period\\. reasonable value of this license\\. if you assert a patent infringement claim against respondent alleging that licensed product directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved \\(such as by license or settlement\\) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses

software distribution \\(\"bsd\"\\) license has proven very effective over the years at allowing for a wide spread of work throughout both commercial and noncommercial products\\. for programrs whose primary intention is to improve the general quality of available software, it is arguable that there is no better license than the bsd license, as it permits improvements to be used wherever they will help, without idealogical or metallic constraint\\. this is of particular value to those who produce reference implementations of proposed standards: the case of tcp\\/ip clearly illustrates that freely and universally available implementations leads the rapid acceptance of standards \\-\\- often even being used instead of a de jure standard \\(eg, osi network models\\)\\. with the rapid proliferation of software licensed under the gnu general public license, however, the continued success of this role is called into question\\. given that the inclusion of a few lines of \"gpl\\-tainted\" work into a larger body of work will result in restricted distribution \\-\\- and given that further work will likely build upon the \"tainted\" portions, making them difficult to remove at a future date \\-\\- there are inevitable circumstances where authors would, in order to protect their goal of providing for the widespread usage of their work, wish to guard against such \"gpl\\-taint\"\\. in addition, one can imagine that companies which operate by producing and selling \\(possibly closed\\-source\\) code would wish to protect themselves against the rise of a gpl\\-licensed competitor\\. while under existing licenses this would mean not releasing their code under any form of open license, if a license existed under which they could incorporate any improvements back into their own \\(commercial\\) products then they might be far more willing to provide for non\\-closed distribution\\. for the above reasons, we put forth this \"bsd protection license\": a license designed to retain the freedom granted by the bsd license to use licensed works in a wide variety of settings, both noncommercial and commercial, while protecting the work from having future contributors restrict that freedom\\. the precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution, and modification follow\\. bsd protection license terms and conditions for copying,

license dans le cadre d\"un modèle de diffusion \"open source\"\\. l\"exercice de ces libertés est assorti de certains devoirs à la charge des utilisateurs afin de préserver ce statut au cours des redistributions ultérieures\\. l\"accessibilité au code source et les droits de copie, de modification et de redistribution qui en découlent ont pour contrepartie de n\"offrir aux utilisateurs qu\"une garantie limitée et de ne faire peser sur l\"auteur du logiciel, le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux et les concédants successifs qu\"une responsabilité restreinte\\. a cet égard l\"attention de l\"utilisateur est attirée sur les risques associés au chargement, à l\"utilization, à la modification et\\/ou au développement et à la reproduction du logiciel par l\"utilisateur étant donné sa spécificité de logiciel libre, qui peut le rendre complexe à manipuler et qui le réserve donc à des développeurs et des professionnels avertis possédant des connaissances informatiques approfondies\\. les utilisateurs sont donc invités à charger et tester l\"adéquation du logiciel à leurs besoins dans des conditions permettant d\"assurer la sécurité de leurs systèmes et ou de leurs données et, plus généralement, à l\"utiliser et l\"exploiter dans les même conditions de sécurité\\. ce contrat peut être reproduit et diffusé librement, sous réserve de le conserver en l\"état, sans ajout ni suppression de clauses\\. ce contrat est susceptible de s\"appliquer à tout logiciel dont le titulaire des droits patrimoniaux décide de soumettre l\"exploitation aux dispositions qu\"il contient\\.

initial developer may designate portions of the covered code as multiple\\-licensed\\. multiple\\-licensed means that the initial developer permits you to utilize portions of the covered code under your choice of the cpal or the alternative licenses, if any, specified by the initial developer in the file described in exhibit a\\. additional term: attribution as a modest attribution to the organizer of the development of the original code \\(\"original developer\"\\), in the hope that its promotional value may help justify the time, money and effort invested in writing the original code, the original developer may include in exhibit b \\(\"attribution information\"\\) a requirement that each time an executable and source code or a larger work is launched or initially run \\(which includes initiating a session\\), a prominent display of the original developer\"s attribution information \\(as defined below\\) must occur on the graphic user interface employed by the end user to access such covered code \\(which may include display on a splash screen\\), if any\\. the size of the graphic image should be consistent with the size of the other elements of the attribution information\\. if the access by the end user to the executable and source code does not create a graphic user interface for access to the covered code, this obligation shall not apply\\. if the original code displays such attribution information in a particular form \\(such as in the form of a splash screen, notice at login, an \"about\" display, or dedicated attribution area on user interface screens\\), continued use of such form for that attribution information is one way of meeting this requirement for notice\\. attribution information may only include a copyright notice, a brief phrase, graphic image and a url \\(\"attribution information\"\\) and is subject to the attribution limits as defined below\\. for these purposes, prominent shall mean display for sufficient duration to give reasonable notice to the user of the identity of the original developer and that if you include attribution information or similar information for other parties, you must ensure that the attribution information for the original developer shall be no less prominent than such attribution information or similar information for the other party\\. for greater certainty, the original developer may choose to specify in exhibit b below that the above attribution requirement only applies to an executable and source code resulting from the original code or any modification, but not a larger work\\. the intent is to provide for reasonably modest attribution, therefore the original developer cannot require that you display, at any time, more than the following information as attribution information: \\(a\\) a copyright notice including the name of the original developer; \\(b\\) a word or one phrase \\(not exceeding 10 words\\); copyright one graphic image provided by the

contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any contributor that the program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity\\. each

grant\\. each contributor hereby grants you a world\\-wide, royalty\\-free, non\\-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property claims: to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the modifications created by such contributor \\(or portions thereof\\) either on an unmodified basis, with other modifications, as covered code or as part of a larger work; and under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by contributor, to utilize the contributor version \\(or portions thereof\\), but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable you to utilize the contributor version \\(or portions thereof\\), and not to any greater extent that may be necessary to utilize further modifications or combinations\\. distribution obligations\\. 3\\.1\\. application of license\\. the modifications which you create or to which you contribute are governed by the terms of this license, including without limitation section 2\\.2\\. the source code version of covered code may be distributed only under the terms of this license or a future version of this license released under section 6\\.1, and you must include a copy of this license with every copy of the source code you distribute\\. you may not offer or impose any terms on any source code version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this license or the recipients\" rights hereunder\\. however, you may include an additional document offering the additional rights described in section 3\\.5\\. 3\\.2\\. availability of source code\\. any modification which you create or to which you contribute must be made available in source code form under the terms of this license either on the same media as an executable version or via an accepted electronic distribution mechanism to anyone to whom you made an executable version available; and if made available via electronic distribution mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve \\(12\\) months after the date it initially became available, or at least six \\(6\\) months after a subsequent version of that particular modification has been made available to such recipients\\. you are responsible for ensuring that the source code version remains available even if the electronic distribution mechanism is maintained by a third party\\. 3\\.3\\. description of modifications\\. you must cause all covered code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the changes you made to create that covered code and the date of any change\\. you must include a prominent statement that the modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from original code provided by the initial developer and including the name of the initial developer in \\(a\\) the source code, and \\(b\\) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the covered code\\. 3\\.4\\. intellectual property matters third party claims\\. if you have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality or code \\(or its utilization under this license\\), you must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \"legal\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact\\. if you obtain such knowledge after you make your modification available as described in section 3\\.2, you shall promptly modify the legal file in all copies you make available thereafter and shall take other steps \\(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups\\) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the covered code that new knowledge has been obtained\\. contributor apis\\. if your modification is an application programming interface and you own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to implement that api, you must also include this information in the legal file\\. 3\\.5\\. required notices\\. you must duplicate the notice in exhibit a in each file of the source code, and this license in any documentation for the source code, where you describe recipients\" rights relating to covered code\\. if you created one or more modification\\(s\\), you may add your name as a contributor to the notice described in exhibit a\\. if it is not possible to put such notice in a particular source code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location \\(such as a relevant directory file\\) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice\\. you may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of covered code\\. however, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the initial developer or any contributor\\. you must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify the initial developer and every contributor for any liability incurred by the initial developer or such contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms you offer\\. 3\\.6\\. distribution of executable versions\\. you may distribute covered code in executable form only if the requirements of section 3\\.1\\-3\\.5 have been met for that covered code, and if you include a notice stating that the source code version of the covered code is available under the terms of this license, including a description of how and where you have fulfillled the obligations of section 3\\.2\\. the notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an executable version, related documentation or collateral in which you descr ibe recipients\" rights relating to the covered code\\. you may distribute the executable version of covered code under a license of your choice, which may contain terms different from this license,provided that you are in compliance with the terms of this license and that the license for the executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient\"s rights in the source code version from the rights set forth in this license\\. if you distribute the executable version under a different license you must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this license are offered by you alone, not by the initial developer or any contributor\\. you hereby agree to indemnify the initial developer and every contributor for any liability incurred by the initial developer or such contributor as a result of any such terms you offer\\. 3\\.7\\. larger works\\. you may create a larger work by combining covered code with other code not governed by the terms of this license and distribute the larger work as a single product\\. in such a case, you must make sure the requirements of this license are fulfillled for the covered code\\. inability to comply due to statute or regulation\\. if it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this license with respect to some or all of the covered code due to statute or regulation then you must: \\(a\\) comply with the terms of this license to the maximum extent possible; and \\(b\\) describe the limitations and the code they affect\\. such description must be included in the legal file described in section 3\\.4 and must be included with all distributions of the source code\\. except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it\\. application of this license\\. this license applies to code to which the initial developer has attached the notice in exhibit a, and to related covered code\\. versions of the license\\. 6\\.1\\. new versions\\. floris van den berg may publish revised and\\/or new versions of the license from time to time\\. each version will be given a distinguishing version number\\. 6\\.2\\. effect of new versions\\. once covered code has been published under a particular version of the license, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version\\. you may also choose to use such covered code under the terms of any subsequent version of the license published by floris van den berg no one other than floris van den berg has the right to modify the terms applicable to covered code created under this license\\. 6\\.3\\. derivative works\\. if you create or use a modified version of this license \\(which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already covered code governed by this license\\), you must \\(a\\) rename your license so that the phrases \"freeimage\", `freeimage public license\", \"fipl\", or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license and \\(b\\) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains terms which differ from the freeimage public license\\. \\(filling in the name of the initial developer, original code or contributor in the notice described in exhibit a shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this

distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed\\. preamble the gnu affero general public license is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure cooperation with the community in the case of network server software\\. the licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works\\. by contrast, our general public licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program\\-\\-to make sure it remains free software for all its users\\. when we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price\\. our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software \\(and charge for them if you wish\\), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things\\. developers that use our general public licenses protect your rights with two steps: \\(1\\) assert copyright on the software, and \\(2\\) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\\/or modify the software\\. a secondary benefit of defending all users\" freedom is that improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they receive widespread use, become available for other developers to incorporate\\. many developers of free software are heartened and encouraged by the resulting cooperation\\. however, in the case of software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about\\. the gnu general public license permits making a modified version and letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its source code to the public\\. the gnu affero general public license is designed specifically to ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available to the community\\. it requires the operator of a network server to provide the source code of the modified version running there to the users of that server\\. therefore, public use of a modified version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source code of the modified version\\. an older license, called the affero general public license and published by affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals\\. this is a different license, not a version of the affero gpl, but affero has released a new version of the affero gpl which permits relicensing under this license\\. the precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\\. terms and conditions definitions\\. \"this license\" refers to version 3 of the gnu affero general public license\\. \" copyright \" also means copyright \\-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks\\. \"the program\" refers to any copyright able work licensed under this license\\. each licensee is addressed as \"you\"\\. \"licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations\\. to \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy\\. the resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work\\. a \"covered work\" means either the unmodified program or a work based on the program\\. to \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy\\. propagation includes copying, distribution \\(with or without modification\\), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well\\. to \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies\\. mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying\\. an interactive user interface displays \"appropriate legal notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that \\(1\\) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and \\(2\\) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work \\(except to the extent that warranties are provided\\), that licensees may convey the work under this license, and how to view a copy of this license\\. if the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion\\. source code\\. the \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it\\. \"object code\" means any non\\-source form of a work\\. a \"standard interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language\\. the \"system libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that \\(a\\) is included in the normal form of packaging a major component, but which is not part of that major component, and \\(b\\) serves only to enable use of the work with that major component, or to implement a standard interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form\\. a \"major component\", in this context, means a major essential component \\(kernel, window system, and so on\\) of the specific operating system \\(if any\\) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it\\. the \"corresponding source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and \\(for an executable work\\) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities\\. however, it does not include the work\"s system libraries, or general\\-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work\\. for example, corresponding source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work\\. the corresponding source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the corresponding source\\. the corresponding source for a work in source code form is that same work\\. basic permissions\\. all rights granted under this license are granted for the term of copyright on the program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met\\. this license explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified program\\. the output from running a covered work is covered by this license only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work\\. this license acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law\\. you may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force\\. you may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this license in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright \\. those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyright ed material outside their relationship with you\\. conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below\\. sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary\\. protecting users\" legal rights from anti\\-circumvention law\\. no covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfillling obligations under article 11 of the wipo copyright treaty adopted on 20 december 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures\\. when you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this license with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\"s users, your or third parties\" legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures\\. conveying verbatim copies\\. you may convey verbatim copies of the program\"s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this license and any non\\-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this license along with the program\\. you may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee\\. conveying modified source versions\\. you may convey a work based on the program, or the modifications to produce it from the program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: the work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date\\. the work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this license and any conditions added under section 7\\. this requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\"\\. you must license the entire work, as a whole, under this license to anyone who comes into possession of a copy\\. this license will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged\\. this license gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it\\. if the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display appropriate legal notices; however, if the program has interactive interfaces that do not display appropriate legal notices, your work need not make them do so\\. a compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\"s users beyond what the individual works permit\\. inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this license to apply to the other parts of the aggregate\\. conveying non\\-source forms\\. you may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine\\-readable corresponding source under the terms of this license, in one of these ways: convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product \\(including a physical distribution medium\\), accompanied by the corresponding source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange\\. convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product \\(including a physical distribution medium\\), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either \\(1\\) a copy of the corresponding source for all the software in the product that is covered by this license, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or \\(2\\) access to copy the corresponding source from a network server at no charge\\. convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the corresponding source\\. this alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b\\. convey the object code by offering access from a designated place \\(gratis or for a charge\\), and offer equivalent access to the corresponding source in the same way through the same place at no further charge\\. you need not require recipients to copy the corresponding source along with the object code\\. if the place to copy the object code is a network server, the corresponding source may be on a different server \\(operated by you or a third party\\) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the corresponding source\\. regardless of what server hosts the corresponding source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements\\. convey the object code using peer\\-to\\-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and corresponding source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d\\. a separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the corresponding source as a system library, need not be included in conveying the object code work\\. a \"user product\" is either \\(1\\) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or \\(2\\) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling\\. in determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage\\. for a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product\\. a product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non\\-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product\\. \"installation information\" for a user product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that user product from a modified version of its corresponding source\\. the information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made\\. if you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a user product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the user product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term \\(regardless of how the transaction is characterized\\), the corresponding source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the installation information\\. but this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the user product \\(for example, the work has been installed in rom\\)\\. the requirement to provide installation information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the user product in which it has been modified or installed\\. access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network\\. corresponding source conveyed, and installation information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented \\(and with an implementation available to the public in source code form\\), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying\\. additional terms\\. \"additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this license by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions\\. additional permissions that are applicable to the entire program shall be treated as though they were included in this license, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law\\. if additional permissions apply only to part of the program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire program remains governed by this license without regard to the additional permissions\\. when you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it\\. \\(additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work\\.\\) you may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission\\. notwithstanding any other provision of this license, for material you add to a covered work, you may \\(if authorized by the copyright holders of that material\\) supplement the terms of this license with terms: disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this license; or requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the appropriate legal notices displayed by works containing it; or prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material \\(or modified versions of it\\) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors\\. all other non\\-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10\\. if the program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this license along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term\\. if a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this license, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying\\. if you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms\\. additional terms, permissive or non\\-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way\\. termination\\. you may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this license\\. any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license \\(including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11\\)\\. however, if you cease all violation of this license, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated \\(a\\) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and \\(b\\) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation\\. moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license \\(for any work\\) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice\\. termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license\\. if your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10\\. acceptance not required for having copies\\. you are not required to accept this license in order to receive or run a copy of the program\\. ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer\\-to\\-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance\\. however, nothing other than this license grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work\\. these actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this license\\. therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so\\. automatic licensing of downstream recipients\\. each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this license\\. you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license\\. an \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations\\. if propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party\"s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the corresponding source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts\\. you may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this license\\. for example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this license, and you may not initiate litigation \\(including a cross\\-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit\\) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the program or any portion of it\\. patents\\. a \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this license of the program or a work on which the program is based\\. the work thus licensed is called the contributor\"s \"contributor version\"\\. a contributor\"s \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this license, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version\\. for purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license\\. each contributor grants you a non\\-exclusive, worldwide, royalty\\-free patent license under the contributor\"s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version\\. in the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent \\(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to s ue for patent infringement\\)\\. to \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party\\. if you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the corresponding source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this license, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either \\(1\\) cause the corresponding source to be so available, or \\(2\\) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or \\(3\\) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients\\. \"knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient\"s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid\\. if, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it\\. a patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non\\-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this license\\. you may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license \\(a\\) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you \\(or copies made from those copies\\), or \\(b\\) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 march 2007\\. nothing in this license shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law\\. no surrender of others\" freedom\\. if conditions are imposed on you \\(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise\\) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license\\. if you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all\\. for example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this license would be to refrain entirely from conveying the program\\. remote network interaction; use with the gnu general public license\\. notwithstanding any other provision of this license, if you modify the program, your modified version must prominently offer all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network \\(if your version supports such interaction\\) an opportunity to receive the corresponding source of your version by providing access to the corresponding source from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software\\. this corresponding source shall include the corresponding source for any work covered by version 3 of the gnu general public license that is incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph\\. notwithstanding any other provision of this license, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the gnu general public license into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work\\. the terms of this license will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version 3 of the gnu general public license\\. revised versions of this license\\. the free software foundation may publish revised and\\/or new versions of the gnu affero general public license from time to time\\. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns\\. each version is given a distinguishing version number\\. if the program specifies that a certain numbered version of the gnu affero general public license \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the free software foundation\\. if the program does not specify a version number of the gnu affero general public license, you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation\\. if the program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the gnu affero general public license can be used, that proxy\"s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the program\\. later license versions may give you additional or different permissions\\. however, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version\\. disclaimer of warranty\\. there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law\\. except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and\\/or other parties provide the program \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you\\. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction\\. limitation of liability\\. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and\\/or conveys the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program \\(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs\\), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\. interpretation of sections 15 and 16\\. if the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the program in return for a fee\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"GNU Affero General Public License

copyright 2000 free software foundation, inc\\. 51 franklin st, fifth floor, boston, ma 02110\\-1301 usa everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed\\. preamble the purpose of this license is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document \"free\" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially\\. secondarily, this license preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others\\. this license is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense\\. it complements the gnu general public license, which is a copyleft license designed for free software\\. we have designed this license in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does\\. but this license is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book\\. we recommend this license principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference\\. applicability and definitions this license applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this license\\. the \"document\", below, refers to any such manual or work\\. any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\"\\. a \"modified version\" of the document means any work containing the document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\\/or translated into another language\\. a \"secondary section\" is a named appendix or a front\\-matter section of the document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the document to the document\"s overall subject \\(or to related matters\\) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject\\. \\(for example, if the document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a secondary section may not explain any mathematics\\.\\) the relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them\\. the \"invariant sections\" are certain secondary sections whose titles are designated, as being those of invariant sections, in the notice that says that the document is released under this license\\. the \"cover texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as front\\-cover texts or back\\-cover texts, in the notice that says that the document is released under this license\\. a \"transparent\" copy of the document means a machine\\-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or \\(for images composed of pixels\\) generic paint programs or \\(for drawings\\) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters\\. a copy made in an otherwise transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not transparent\\. a copy that is not \"transparent\" is called \"opaque\"\\. examples of suitable formats for transparent copies include plain ascii without markup, texinfo input format, latex input format, sgml or xml using a publicly available dtd, and standard\\-conforming simple html designed for human modification\\. opaque formats include postscript, pdf, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, sgml or xml for which the dtd and\\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine\\-generated html produced by some word processors for output purposes only\\. the \"title page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this license requires to appear in the title page\\. for works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"title page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\"s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text\\. verbatim copying you may copy and distribute the document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this license, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this license applies to the document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this license\\. you may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute\\. however, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies\\. if you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3\\. you may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies\\. copying in quantity if you publish printed copies of the document numbering more than 100, and the document\"s license notice requires cover texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these cover texts: front\\-cover texts on the front cover, and back\\-cover texts on the back cover\\. both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies\\. the front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible\\. you may add other material on the covers in addition\\. copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects\\. if the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed \\(as many as fit reasonably\\) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages\\. if you publish or distribute opaque copies of the document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine\\-readable transparent copy along with each opaque copy, or state in or with each opaque copy a publicly\\-accessible computer\\-network location containing a complete transparent copy of the document, free of added material, which the general network\\-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public\\-standard network protocols\\. if you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an opaque copy \\(directly or through your agents or retailers\\) of that edition to the public\\. it is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the document\\. modifications you may copy and distribute a modified version of the document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the modified version under precisely this license, with the modified version filling the role of the document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the modified version to whoever possesses a copy of it\\. in addition, you must do these things in the modified version: use in the title page \\(and on the covers, if any\\) a title distinct from that of the document, and from those of previous versions \\(which should, if there were any, be listed in the history section of the document\\)\\. you may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission\\. list on the title page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the modified version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the document \\(all of its principal authors, if it has less than five\\)\\. state on the title page the name of the publisher of the modified version, as the publisher\\. preserve all the copyright notices of the document\\. add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices\\. include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the modified version under the terms of this license, in the form shown in the addendum below\\. preserve in that license notice the full lists of invariant sections and required cover texts given in the document\"s license notice\\. include an unaltered copy of this license\\. preserve the section entitled \"history\", and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the modified version as given on the title page\\. if there is no section entitled \"history\" in the document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the document as given on its title page, then add an item describing the modified version as stated in the previous sentence\\. preserve the network location, if any, given in the document for public access to a transparent copy of the document, and likewise the network locations given in the document for previous versions it was based on\\. these may be placed in the \"history\" section\\. you may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission\\. in any section entitled \"acknowledgements\" or \"dedications\", preserve the section\"s title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\\/or dedications given therein\\. preserve all the invariant sections of the document, unaltered in their text and in their titles\\. section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles\\. delete any section entitled \"endorsements\"\\. such a section may not be included in the modified version\\. do not retitle any existing section as \"endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any invariant section\\. if the modified version includes new front\\-matter sections or appendices that qualify as secondary sections and contain no material copied from the document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant\\. to do this, add their titles to the list of invariant sections in the modified version\"s license notice\\. these titles must be distinct from any other section titles\\. you may add a section entitled \"endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your modified version by various parties\\-\\-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard\\. you may add a passage of up to five words as a front\\-cover text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a back\\-cover text, to the end of the list of cover texts in the modified version\\. only one passage of front\\-cover text and one of back\\-cover text may be added by \\(or through arrangements made by\\) any one entity\\. if the document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one\\. the author\\(s\\) and publisher\\(s\\) of the document do not by this license give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any modified version\\. combining documents you may combine the document with other documents released under this license, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the invariant sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as invariant sections of your combined work in its license notice\\. the combined work need only contain one copy of this license, and multiple identical invariant sections may be replaced with a single copy\\. if there are multiple invariant sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number\\. make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of invariant sections in the license notice of the combined work\\. in the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"history\" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled \"history\"; likewise combine any sections entitled \"acknowledgements\", and any sections entitled \"dedications\"\\. you must delete all sections entitled \"endorsements\\.\" collections of documents you may make a collection consisting of the document and other documents released under this license, and replace the individual copies of this license in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this license for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects\\. you may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this license, provided you insert a copy of this license into the extracted document, and follow this license in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document\\. aggregation with independent works a compilation of the document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a modified version of the document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation\\. such a compilation is called an \"aggregate\", and this license does not apply to the other self\\-contained works thus compiled with the document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the document\\. if the cover text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the document, then if the document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the document\"s cover texts may be placed on covers that surround only the document within the aggregate\\. otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate\\. translation translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the document under the terms of section 4\\. replacing invariant sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all invariant sections in addition to the original versions of these invariant sections\\. you may include a translation of this license provided that you also include the original english version of this license\\. in case of a disagreement between the translation and the original english version of this license, the original english version will prevail\\. termination you may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the document except as expressly provided for under this license\\. any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license\\. however, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\\. future revisions of this license the free software foundation may publish new, revised versions of the gnu free documentation license from time to time\\. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns\\. see http:\\/\\/www\\.gnu\\.org\\/copyleft\\/\\. each version of the license is given a distinguishing version number\\. if the document specifies that a particular numbered version of this license \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of

to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially\\. secondarily, this license preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others\\. this license is a kind of \"copyleft\", which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense\\. it complements the gnu general public license, which is a copyleft license designed for free software\\. we have designed this license in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does\\. but this license is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book\\. we recommend this license principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference\\. applicability and definitions this license applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this license\\. such a notice grants a world\\-wide, royalty\\-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein\\. the \"document\", below, refers to any such manual or work\\. any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \"you\"\\. you accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law\\. a \"modified version\" of the document means any work containing the document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and\\/or translated into another language\\. a \"secondary section\" is a named appendix or a front\\-matter section of the document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the document to the document\"s overall subject \\(or to related matters\\) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject\\. \\(thus, if the document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a secondary section may not explain any mathematics\\.\\) the relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them\\. the \"invariant sections\" are certain secondary sections whose titles are designated, as being those of invariant sections, in the notice that says that the document is released under this license\\. if a section does not fit the above definition of secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as invariant\\. the document may contain zero invariant sections\\. if the document does not identify any invariant sections then there are none\\. the \"cover texts\" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as front\\-cover texts or back\\-cover texts, in the notice that says that the document is released under this license\\. a front\\-cover text may be at most 5 words, and a back\\-cover text may be at most 25 words\\. a \"transparent\" copy of the document means a machine\\-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or \\(for images composed of pixels\\) generic paint programs or \\(for drawings\\) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters\\. a copy made in an otherwise transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not transparent\\. an image format is not transparent if used for any substantial amount of text\\. a copy that is not \"transparent\" is called \"opaque\"\\. examples of suitable formats for transparent copies include plain ascii without markup, texinfo input format, latex input format, sgml or xml using a publicly available dtd, and standard\\-conforming simple html, postscript or pdf designed for human modification\\. examples of transparent image formats include png, xcf and jpg\\. opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, sgml or xml for which the dtd and\\/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine\\-generated html, postscript or pdf produced by some word processors for output purposes only\\. the \"title page\" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this license requires to appear in the title page\\. for works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \"title page\" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\"s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text\\. a section \"entitled xyz\" means a named subunit of the document whose title either is precisely xyz or contains xyz in parentheses following text that translates xyz in another language\\. \\(here xyz stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \"acknowledgements\", \"dedications\", \"endorsements\", or \"history\"\\.\\) to \"preserve the title\" of such a section when you modify the document means that it remains a section \"entitled xyz\" according to this definition\\. the document may include warranty disclaimers next to the notice which states that this license applies to the document\\. these warranty disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this license, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these warranty disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this license\\. verbatim copying you may copy and distribute the document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this license, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this license applies to the document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this license\\. you may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute\\. however, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies\\. if you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3\\. you may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies\\. copying in quantity if you publish printed copies \\(or copies in media that commonly have printed covers\\) of the document, numbering more than 100, and the document\"s license notice requires cover texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these cover texts: front\\-cover texts on the front cover, and back\\-cover texts on the back cover\\. both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies\\. the front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible\\. you may add other material on the covers in addition\\. copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects\\. if the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed \\(as many as fit reasonably\\) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages\\. if you publish or distribute opaque copies of the document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine\\-readable transparent copy along with each opaque copy, or state in or with each opaque copy a computer\\-network location from which the general network\\-using public has access to download using public\\-standard network protocols a complete transparent copy of the document, free of added material\\. if you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an opaque copy \\(directly or through your agents or retailers\\) of that edition to the public\\. it is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the document\\. modifications you may copy and distribute a modified version of the document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the modified version under precisely this license, with the modified version filling the role of the document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the modified version to whoever possesses a copy of it\\. in addition, you must do these things in the modified version: use in the title page \\(and on the covers, if any\\) a title distinct from that of the document, and from those of previous versions \\(which should, if there were any, be listed in the history section of the document\\)\\. you may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission\\. list on the title page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the modified version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the document \\(all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five\\), unless they release you from this requirement\\. state on the title page the name of the publisher of the modified version, as the publisher\\. preserve all the copyright notices of the document\\. add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices\\. include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the modified version under the terms of this license, in the form shown in the addendum below\\. preserve in that license notice the full lists of invariant sections and required cover texts given in the document\"s license notice\\. include an unaltered copy of this license\\. preserve the section entitled \"history\", preserve its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the modified version as given on the title page\\. if there is no section entitled \"history\" in the document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the document as given on its title page, then add an item describing the modified version as stated in the previous sentence\\. preserve the network location, if any, given in the document for public access to a transparent copy of the document, and likewise the network locations given in the document for previous versions it was based on\\. these may be placed in the \"history\" section\\. you may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission\\. for any section entitled \"acknowledgements\" or \"dedications\", preserve the title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and\\/or dedications given therein\\. preserve all the invariant sections of the document, unaltered in their text and in their titles\\. section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles\\. delete any section entitled \"endorsements\"\\. such a section may not be included in the modified version\\. do not retitle any existing section to be entitled \"endorsements\" or to conflict in title with any invariant section\\. preserve any warranty disclaimers\\. if the modified version includes new front\\-matter sections or appendices that qualify as secondary sections and contain no material copied from the document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant\\. to do this, add their titles to the list of invariant sections in the modified version\"s license notice\\. these titles must be distinct from any other section titles\\. you may add a section entitled \"endorsements\", provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your modified version by various parties\\-\\-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard\\. you may add a passage of up to five words as a front\\-cover text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a back\\-cover text, to the end of the list of cover texts in the modified version\\. only one passage of front\\-cover text and one of back\\-cover text may be added by \\(or through arrangements made by\\) any one entity\\. if the document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one\\. the author\\(s\\) and publisher\\(s\\) of the document do not by this license give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any modified version\\. combining documents you may combine the document with other documents released under this license, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the invariant sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as invariant sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their warranty disclaimers\\. the combined work need only contain one copy of this license, and multiple identical invariant sections may be replaced with a single copy\\. if there are multiple invariant sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number\\. make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of invariant sections in the license notice of the combined work\\. in the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"history\" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled \"history\"; likewise combine any sections entitled \"acknowledgements\", and any sections entitled \"dedications\"\\. you must delete all sections entitled \"endorsements\"\\. collections of documents you may make a collection consisting of the document and other documents released under this license, and replace the individual copies of this license in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this license for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects\\. you may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this license, provided you insert a copy of this license into the extracted document, and follow this license in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document\\. aggregation with independent works a compilation of the document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation\"s users beyond what the individual works permit\\. when the document is included in an aggregate, this license does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the document\\. if the cover text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the document, then if the document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the document\"s cover texts may be placed on covers that bracket the document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the document is in electronic form\\. otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate\\. translation translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the document under the terms of section 4\\. replacing invariant sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all invariant sections in addition to the original versions of these invariant sections\\. you may include a translation of this license, and all the license notices in the document, and any warranty disclaimers, provided that you also include the original english version of this license and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers\\. in case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this license or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail\\. if a section in the document is entitled \"acknowledgements\", \"dedications\", or \"history\", the requirement \\(section 4\\) to preserve its title \\(section 1\\) will typically require changing the actual title\\. termination you may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the document except as expressly provided for under this license\\. any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license\\. however, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\\. future revisions of this license the free software foundation may publish new, revised versions of the gnu free documentation license from time to time\\. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns\\. see http:\\/\\/www\\.gnu\\.org\\/copyleft\\/\\. each version of the license is given a distinguishing version number\\. if the document specifies that a particular numbered version of this license \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published \\(not as a draft\\) by the free software foundation\\. if the document does not specify a version number of this license, you may choose any version ever published \\(not as a draft\\) by the free software foundation\\. addendum: how to use this license for your documents to use this license in a document you have written, include a copy of the license in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: copyright year your name\\. permission is granted to copy, distribute and\\/or modify this document under the terms of the gnu free documentation license, version 1\\.2 or any later version published by the free software foundation; with no invariant sections, no front\\-cover texts, and no back\\-cover texts\\. a copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"gnu free documentation license\"\\. if you have invariant sections, front\\-cover texts and back\\-cover texts, replace the \"with\\.\\.\\.texts\\.\" line with this: with the invariant sections being list their titles, with the front\\-cover texts being list, and with the back\\-cover texts being list\\. if you have invariant sections without cover texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation\\. if your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the gnu general public license, to permit their use in free software\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"GNU Free Documentation

the list of invariant sections in the license notice of the combined work\\. in the combination, you must combine any sections entitled \"history\" in the various original documents, forming one section entitled \"history\"; likewise combine any sections entitled \"acknowledgements\", and any sections entitled \"dedications\"\\. you must delete all sections entitled \"endorsements\"\\. collections of documents you may make a collection consisting of the document and other documents released under this license, and replace the individual copies of this license in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this license for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects\\. you may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this license, provided you insert a copy of this license into the extracted document, and follow this license in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document\\. aggregation with independent works a compilation of the document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation\"s users beyond what the individual works permit\\. when the document is included in an aggregate, this license does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the document\\. if the cover text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the document, then if the document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the document\"s cover texts may be placed on covers that bracket the document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the document is in electronic form\\. otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate\\. translation translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the document under the terms of section 4\\. replacing invariant sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all invariant sections in addition to the original versions of these invariant sections\\. you may include a translation of this license, and all the license notices in the document, and any warranty disclaimers, provided that you also include the original english version of this license and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers\\. in case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this license or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail\\. if a section in the document is entitled \"acknowledgements\", \"dedications\", or \"history\", the requirement \\(section 4\\) to preserve its title \\(section 1\\) will typically require changing the actual title\\. termination you may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the document except as expressly provided under this license\\. any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license\\. however, if you cease all violation of this license, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated \\(a\\) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and \\(b\\) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation\\. moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license \\(for any work\\) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice\\. termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license\\. if your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it\\. future revisions of this license the free software foundation may publish new, revised versions of the gnu free documentation license from time to time\\. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns\\. see http:\\/\\/www\\.gnu\\.org\\/copyleft\\/\\. each version of the license is given a distinguishing version number\\. if the document specifies that a particular numbered version of this license \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published \\(not as a draft\\) by the free software foundation\\. if the document does not specify a version number of this license, you may choose any version ever published \\(not as a draft\\) by the free software foundation\\. if the document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this license can be used, that proxy\"s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the document\\. relicensing \"massive multiauthor collaboration site\" \\(or \"mmc site\"\\) means any world wide web server that publishes copyright able works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works\\. a public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server\\. a \"massive multiauthor collaboration\" \\(or \"mmc\"\\) contained in the site means any set of copyright able works thus published on the mmc site\\. \"cc\\-by\\-sa\" means the creative commons attribution\\-share alike 3\\.0 license published by creative commons corporation, a not\\-for\\-profit corporation with a principal place of business in san francisco, california, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization\\. \"incorporate\" means to publish or republish a document, in whole or in part, as part of another document\\. an mmc is \"eligible for relicensing\" if it is licensed under this license, and if all works that were first published under this license somewhere other than this mmc, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the mmc, \\(1\\) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and \\(2\\) were thus incorporated prior to november 1, 2008\\. the operator of an mmc site may republish an mmc contained in the site under cc\\-by\\-sa on the same site at any time before august 1, 2009, provided the mmc is eligible for relicensing\\. addendum: how to use this license for your documents to use this license in a document you have written, include a copy of the license in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: copyright year your name\\. permission is granted to copy, distribute and\\/or modify this document under the terms of the gnu free documentation license, version 1\\.3 or any later version published by the free software foundation; with no invariant sections, no front\\-cover texts, and no back\\-cover texts\\. a copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"gnu free documentation license\"\\. if you have invariant sections, front\\-cover texts and back\\-cover texts, replace the \"with\\.\\.\\.texts\\.\" line with this: with the invariant sections being list their titles, with the front\\-cover texts being list, and with the back\\-cover texts being list\\. if you have invariant sections without cover texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation\\. if your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the gnu general public license, to permit their use in free software\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"GNU General Public License v1.0

this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices\\. many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\\. this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license\\. if the distribution and\\/or use of the program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyright ed interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the program under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\\. in such case, this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license\\. the free software foundation may publish revised and\\/or new versions of the general public license from time to time\\. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns\\. each version is given a distinguishing version number\\. if the program specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation\\. if the program does not specify a version number of this license, you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation\\. if you wish to incorporate parts of the program into other free programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission\\. for software which is copyright ed by the free software foundation, write to the free software foundation;

verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed\\. preamble the gnu general public license is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works\\. the licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works\\. by contrast, the gnu general public license is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program\\-\\-to make sure it remains free software for all its users\\. we, the free software foundation, use the gnu general public license for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors\\. you can apply it to your programs, too\\. when we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price\\. our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software \\(and charge for them if you wish\\), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things\\. to protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights\\. therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others\\. for example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received\\. you must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\\. and you must show them these terms so they know their rights\\. developers that use the gnu gpl protect your rights with two steps: \\(1\\) assert copyright on the software, and \\(2\\) offer you this license giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and\\/or modify it\\. for the developers\" and authors\" protection, the gpl clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software\\. for both users\" and authors\" sake, the gpl requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions\\. some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so\\. this is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users\" freedom to change the software\\. the systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable\\. therefore, we have designed this version of the gpl to prohibit the practice for those products\\. if such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the gpl, as needed to protect the freedom of users\\. finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents\\. states should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general\\-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary\\. to prevent this, the gpl assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non\\-free\\. the precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\\. terms and conditions definitions\\. \"this license\" refers to version 3 of the gnu general public license\\. \" copyright \" also means copyright \\-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks\\. \"the program\" refers to any copyright able work licensed under this license\\. each licensee is addressed as \"you\"\\. \"licensees\" and \"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations\\. to \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy\\. the resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the earlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work\\. a \"covered work\" means either the unmodified program or a work based on the program\\. to \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy\\. propagation includes copying, distribution \\(with or without modification\\), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well\\. to \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies\\. mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying\\. an interactive user interface displays \"appropriate legal notices\" to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that \\(1\\) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and \\(2\\) tells the user that there is no warranty for the work \\(except to the extent that warranties are provided\\), that licensees may convey the work under this license, and how to view a copy of this license\\. if the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion\\. source code\\. the \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it\\. \"object code\" means any non\\-source form of a work\\. a \"standard interface\" means an interface that either is an official standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers working in that language\\. the \"system libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other than the work as a whole, that \\(a\\) is included in the normal form of packaging a major component, but which is not part of that major component, and \\(b\\) serves only to enable use of the work with that major component, or to implement a standard interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form\\. a \"major component\", in this context, means a major essential component \\(kernel, window system, and so on\\) of the specific operating system \\(if any\\) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it\\. the \"corresponding source\" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and \\(for an executable work\\) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities\\. however, it does not include the work\"s system libraries, or general\\-purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of the work\\. for example, corresponding source includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work\\. the corresponding source need not include anything that users can regenerate automatically from other parts of the corresponding source\\. the corresponding source for a work in source code form is that same work\\. basic permissions\\. all rights granted under this license are granted for the term of copyright on the program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met\\. this license explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified program\\. the output from running a covered work is covered by this license only if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work\\. this license acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law\\. you may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force\\. you may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this license in conveying all material for which you do not control copyright \\. those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyright ed material outside their relationship with you\\. conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions stated below\\. sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary\\. protecting users\" legal rights from anti\\-circumvention law\\. no covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any applicable law fulfillling obligations under article 11 of the wipo copyright treaty adopted on 20 december 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such measures\\. when you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising rights under this license with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work\"s users, your or third parties\" legal rights to forbid circumvention of technological measures\\. conveying verbatim copies\\. you may convey verbatim copies of the program\"s source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this license and any non\\-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this license along with the program\\. you may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee\\. conveying modified source versions\\. you may convey a work based on the program, or the modifications to produce it from the program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: the work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date\\. the work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this license and any conditions added under section 7\\. this requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to \"keep intact all notices\"\\. you must license the entire work, as a whole, under this license to anyone who comes into possession of a copy\\. this license will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged\\. this license gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it\\. if the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display appropriate legal notices; however, if the program has interactive interfaces that do not display appropriate legal notices, your work need not make them do so\\. a compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation\"s users beyond what the individual works permit\\. inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate does not cause this license to apply to the other parts of the aggregate\\. conveying non\\-source forms\\. you may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine\\-readable corresponding source under the terms of this license, in one of these ways: convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product \\(including a physical distribution medium\\), accompanied by the corresponding source fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange\\. convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product \\(including a physical distribution medium\\), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either \\(1\\) a copy of the corresponding source for all the software in the product that is covered by this license, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or \\(2\\) access to copy the corresponding source from a network server at no charge\\. convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to provide the corresponding source\\. this alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b\\. convey the object code by offering access from a designated place \\(gratis or for a charge\\), and offer equivalent access to the corresponding source in the same way through the same place at no further charge\\. you need not require recipients to copy the corresponding source along with the object code\\. if the place to copy the object code is a network server, the corresponding source may be on a different server \\(operated by you or a third party\\) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the corresponding source\\. regardless of what server hosts the corresponding source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements\\. convey the object code using peer\\-to\\-peer transmission, provided you inform other peers where the object code and corresponding source of the work are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d\\. a separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the corresponding source as a system library, need not be included in conveying the object code work\\. a \"user product\" is either \\(1\\) a \"consumer product\", which means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household purposes, or \\(2\\) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling\\. in determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage\\. for a particular product received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product\\. a product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or non\\-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant mode of use of the product\\. \"installation information\" for a user product means any methods, procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified versions of a covered work in that user product from a modified version of its corresponding source\\. the information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because modification has been made\\. if you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for use in, a user product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the user product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term \\(regardless of how the transaction is characterized\\), the corresponding source conveyed under this section must be accompanied by the installation information\\. but this requirement does not apply if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code on the user product \\(for example, the work has been installed in rom\\)\\. the requirement to provide installation information does not include a requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the user product in which it has been modified or installed\\. access to a network may be denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the network\\. corresponding source conveyed, and installation information provided, in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented \\(and with an implementation available to the public in source code form\\), and must require no special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying\\. additional terms\\. \"additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this license by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions\\. additional permissions that are applicable to the entire program shall be treated as though they were included in this license, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law\\. if additional permissions apply only to part of the program, that part may be used separately under those permissions, but the entire program remains governed by this license without regard to the additional permissions\\. when you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it\\. \\(additional permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you modify the work\\.\\) you may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission\\. notwithstanding any other provision of this license, for material you add to a covered work, you may \\(if authorized by the copyright holders of that material\\) supplement the terms of this license with terms: disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16 of this license; or requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author attributions in that material or in the appropriate legal notices displayed by works containing it; or prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the original version; or limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material; or declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone who conveys the material \\(or modified versions of it\\) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors\\. all other non\\-permissive additional terms are considered \"further restrictions\" within the meaning of section 10\\. if the program as you received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this license along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term\\. if a license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this license, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such relicensing or conveying\\. if you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms\\. additional terms, permissive or non\\-permissive, may be stated in the form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply either way\\. termination\\. you may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this license\\. any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license \\(including any patent licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11\\)\\. however, if you cease all violation of this license, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated \\(a\\) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and \\(b\\) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation\\. moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license \\(for any work\\) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice\\. termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this license\\. if your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same material under section 10\\. acceptance not required for having copies\\. you are not required to accept this license in order to receive or run a copy of the program\\. ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer\\-to\\-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance\\. however, nothing other than this license grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work\\. these actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this license\\. therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so\\. automatic licensing of downstream recipients\\. each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this license\\. you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license\\. an \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging organizations\\. if propagation of a covered work results from an entity transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the party\"s predecessor in interest had or could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the corresponding source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts\\. you may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this license\\. for example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this license, and you may not initiate litigation \\(including a cross\\-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit\\) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the program or any portion of it\\. patents\\. a \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this license of the program or a work on which the program is based\\. the work thus licensed is called the contributor\"s \"contributor version\"\\. a contributor\"s \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this license, of making, using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version\\. for purposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license\\. each contributor grants you a non\\-exclusive, worldwide, royalty\\-free patent license under the contributor\"s essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor version\\. in the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent \\(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement\\)\\. to \"grant\" such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party\\. if you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the corresponding source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this license, through a publicly available network server or other readily accessible means, then you must either \\(1\\) cause the corresponding source to be so available, or \\(2\\) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or \\(3\\) arrange, in a manner consistent with the requirements of this license, to extend the patent license to downstream recipients\\. \"knowingly relying\" means you have actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your recipient\"s use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid\\. if, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and works based on it\\. a patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non\\-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this license\\. you may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license \\(a\\) in connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you \\(or copies made from those copies\\), or \\(b\\) primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 march 2007\\. nothing in this license shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law\\. no surrender of others\" freedom\\. if conditions are imposed on you \\(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise\\) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license\\. if you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all\\. for example, if you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey the program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this license would be to refrain entirely from conveying the program\\. use with the gnu affero general public license\\. notwithstanding any other provision of this license, you have permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the gnu affero general public license into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work\\. the terms of this license will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the gnu affero general public license, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such\\. revised versions of this license\\. the free software foundation may publish revised and\\/or new versions of the gnu general public license from time to time\\. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns\\. each version is given a distinguishing version number\\. if the program specifies that a certain numbered version of the gnu general public license \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the free software foundation\\. if the program does not specify a version number of the gnu general public license, you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation\\. if the program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the gnu general public license can be used, that proxy\"s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the program\\. later license versions may give you additional or different permissions\\. however, no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later version\\. disclaimer of warranty\\. there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law\\. except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and\\/or other parties provide the program \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you\\. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction\\. limitation of liability\\. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and\\/or conveys the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the program \\(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the program to operate with any other programs\\), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\. interpretation of sections 15 and 16\\. if the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the program in return for a fee\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"GNU General Public License v3.0

lesser gpl\\. it also counts as the successor of the gnu library public license, version 2, hence the version number 2\\.1\\.\\] preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it\\. by contrast, the gnu general public licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software\\-\\-to make sure the software is free for all its users\\. this license, the lesser general public license, applies to some specially designated software packages\\-\\-typically libraries\\-\\-of the free software foundation and other authors who decide to use it\\. you can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary general public license is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below\\. when we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price\\. our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software \\(and charge for this service if you wish\\); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things\\. to protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights\\. these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it\\. for example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you\\. you must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\\. if you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling it\\. and you must show them these terms so they know their rights\\. we protect your rights with a two\\-step method: \\(1\\) we copyright the library, and \\(2\\) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\\/or modify the library\\. to protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free library\\. also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the original author\"s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by others\\. finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program\\. we wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder\\. therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license\\. most gnu software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary gnu general public license\\. this license, the gnu lesser general public license, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary general public license\\. we use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non\\-free programs\\. when a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library\\. the ordinary general public license therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom\\. the lesser general public license permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the library\\. we call this license the \"lesser\" general public license because it does less to protect the user\"s freedom than the ordinary general public license\\. it also provides other free software developers less of an advantage over competing non\\-free programs\\. these disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary general public license for many libraries\\. however, the lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances\\. for example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de\\-facto standard\\. to achieve this, non\\-free programs must be allowed to use the library\\. a more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used non\\-free libraries\\. in this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the lesser general public license\\. in other cases, permission to use a particular library in non\\-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software\\. for example, permission to use the gnu c library in non\\-free programs enables many more people to use the whole gnu operating system, as well as its variant, the gnu\\/linux operating system\\. although the lesser general public license is less protective of the users\" freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the library\\. the precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\\. pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\"\\. the former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order to run\\. terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification this license agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this lesser general public license \\(also called \"this license\"\\)\\. each licensee is addressed as \"you\"\\. a \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\\/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs \\(which use some of those functions and data\\) to form executables\\. the \"library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms\\. a \"work based on the library\" means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\\/or translated straightforwardly into another language\\. \\(hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\"\\.\\) \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it\\. for a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library\\. activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope\\. the act of running a program using the library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library \\(independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it\\)\\. whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does\\. you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the library\"s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this license along with the library\\. you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\\. you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: the modified work must itself be a software library\\. you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change\\. you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license\\. if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful\\. \\(for example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well\\-defined independent of the application\\. therefore, subsection 2d requires that any application\\-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots\\.\\) these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole\\. if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this license, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works\\. but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it\\. thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library\\. in addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library \\(or with a work based on the library\\) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license\\. you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library\\. to do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this license, so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license, version 2, instead of to this license\\. \\(if a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish\\.\\) do not make any other change in these notices\\. once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy\\. this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library\\. you may copy and distribute the library \\(or a portion or derivative of it, under section 2\\) in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine\\-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange\\. if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code\\. a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library, but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the library\"\\. such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this license\\. however, linking a \"work that uses the library\" with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library \\(because it contains portions of the library\\), rather than a \"work that uses the library\"\\. the executable is therefore covered by this license\\. section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables\\. when a \"work that uses the library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not\\. whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library, or if the work is itself a library\\. the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law\\. if such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions \\(ten lines or less in length\\), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work\\. \\(executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section 6\\.\\) otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section 6\\. any executables containing that work also fall under section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself\\. as an exception to the sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the library\" with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\"s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications\\. you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license\\. you must supply a copy of this license\\. if the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license\\. also, you must do one of these things: accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine\\-readable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work \\(which must be distributed under sections 1 and 2 above\\); and, if the work is an executable linked with the library, with the complete machine\\-readable \"work that uses the library\", as object code and\\/or source code, so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library\\. \\(it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions\\.\\) use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the library\\. a suitable mechanism is one that \\(1\\) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the user\"s computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and \\(2\\) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface\\-compatible with the version that the work was made with\\. accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution\\. if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place\\. verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy\\. for an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it\\. however, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed \\(in either source or binary form\\) with the major components \\(compiler, kernel, and so on\\) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable\\. it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system\\. such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute\\. you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library side\\-by\\-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library, uncombined with any other library facilities\\. this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above\\. give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work\\. you may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license\\. any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license\\. however, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\\. you are not required to accept this license, since you have not signed it\\. however, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works\\. these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license\\. therefore, by modifying or distributing the library \\(or any work based on the library\\), you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the library or works based on it\\. each time you redistribute the library \\(or any work based on the library\\), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions\\. you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\" exercise of the rights granted herein\\. you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license\\. if, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason \\(not limited to patent issues\\), conditions are imposed on you \\(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise\\) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license\\. if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all\\. for example, if a patent license would not permit royalty\\-free redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library\\. if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances\\. it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices\\. many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\\. this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license\\. if the distribution and\\/or use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyright ed interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\\. in such case, this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license\\. the free software foundation may publish revised and\\/or new versions of the lesser general public license from time to time\\. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns\\. each version is given a distinguishing version number\\. if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation\\. if the library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation\\. if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission\\. for software which is copyright ed by the free software foundation, write to the free software foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this\\. our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally\\. no warranty because the library is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the library, to the extent permitted by applicable law\\. except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and\\/or other parties provide the library \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you\\. should the library prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction\\. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and\\/or redistribute the library as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the library \\(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the library to operate with any other software\\), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"GNU Lesser

it is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary gpl\\.\\] preamble the licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it\\. by contrast, the gnu general public licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software\\-\\-to make sure the software is free for all its users\\. this license, the library general public license, applies to some specially designated free software foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it\\. you can use it for your libraries, too\\. when we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price\\. our general public licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software \\(and charge for this service if you wish\\), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things\\. to protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights\\. these restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it\\. for example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you\\. you must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code\\. if you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it\\. and you must show them these terms so they know their rights\\. our method of protecting your rights has two steps: \\(1\\) copyright the library, and \\(2\\) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and\\/or modify the library\\. also, for each distributor\"s protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library\\. if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors\" reputations\\. finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents\\. we wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software\\. to prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone\"s free use or not licensed at all\\. most gnu software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary gnu general public license, which was designed for utility programs\\. this license, the gnu library general public license, applies to certain designated libraries\\. this license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don\"t assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license\\. the reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it\\. linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program\\. however, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary general public license treats it as such\\. because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary general public license for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries\\. we concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better\\. however, unrestricted linking of non\\-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves\\. this library general public license is intended to permit developers of non\\-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them\\. \\(we have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the library\\.\\) the hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries\\. the precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow\\. pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\"\\. the former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library\\. note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary general public license rather than by this special one\\. terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification this license agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this library general public license \\(also called \"this license\"\\)\\. each licensee is addressed as \"you\"\\. a \"library\" means a collection of software functions and\\/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs \\(which use some of those functions and data\\) to form executables\\. the \"library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms\\. a \"work based on the library\" means either the library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\\/or translated straightforwardly into another language\\. \\(hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\"\\.\\) \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it\\. for a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library\\. activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope\\. the act of running a program using the library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the library \\(independent of the use of the library in a tool for writing it\\)\\. whether that is true depends on what the library does and what the program that uses the library does\\. you may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the library\"s complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this license and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this license along with the library\\. you may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\\. you may modify your copy or copies of the library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: the modified work must itself be a software library\\. you must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change\\. you must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license\\. if a facility in the modified library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful\\. \\(for example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well\\-defined independent of the application\\. therefore, subsection 2d requires that any application\\-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots\\.\\) these requirements apply to the modified work as a whole\\. if identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this license, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works\\. but when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this license, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it\\. thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the library\\. in addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the library with the library \\(or with a work based on the library\\) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license\\. you may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary gnu general public license instead of this license to a given copy of the library\\. to do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this license, so that they refer to the ordinary gnu general public license, version 2, instead of to this license\\. \\(if a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary gnu general public license has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish\\.\\) do not make any other change in these notices\\. once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary gnu general public license applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy\\. this option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the library into a program that is not a library\\. you may copy and distribute the library \\(or a portion or derivative of it, under section 2\\) in object code or executable form under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine\\-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange\\. if distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code\\. a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the library, but is designed to work with the library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the library\"\\. such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this license\\. however, linking a \"work that uses the library\" with the library creates an executable that is a derivative of the library \\(because it contains portions of the library\\), rather than a \"work that uses the library\"\\. the executable is therefore covered by this license\\. section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables\\. when a \"work that uses the library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the library even though the source code is not\\. whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the library, or if the work is itself a library\\. the threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law\\. if such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions \\(ten lines or less in length\\), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work\\. \\(executables containing this object code plus portions of the library will still fall under section 6\\.\\) otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of section 6\\. any executables containing that work also fall under section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the library itself\\. as an exception to the sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the library\" with the library to produce a work containing portions of the library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer\"s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications\\. you must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the library is used in it and that the library and its use are covered by this license\\. you must supply a copy of this license\\. if the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license\\. also, you must do one of these things: accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine\\-readable source code for the library including whatever changes were used in the work \\(which must be distributed under sections 1 and 2 above\\); and, if the work is an executable linked with the library, with the complete machine\\-readable \"work that uses the library\", as object code and\\/or source code, so that the user can modify the library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified library\\. \\(it is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions\\.\\) accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution\\. if distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place\\. verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy\\. for an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it\\. however, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed \\(in either source or binary form\\) with the major components \\(compiler, kernel, and so on\\) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable\\. it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system\\. such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the library together in an executable that you distribute\\. you may place library facilities that are a work based on the library side\\-by\\-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this license, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the library, uncombined with any other library facilities\\. this must be distributed under the terms of the sections above\\. give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work\\. you may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the library except as expressly provided under this license\\. any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license\\. however, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\\. you are not required to accept this license, since you have not signed it\\. however, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the library or its derivative works\\. these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license\\. therefore, by modifying or distributing the library \\(or any work based on the library\\), you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the library or works based on it\\. each time you redistribute the library \\(or any work based on the library\\), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the library subject to these terms and conditions\\. you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\" exercise of the rights granted herein\\. you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this license\\. if, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason \\(not limited to patent issues\\), conditions are imposed on you \\(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise\\) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license\\. if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the library at all\\. for example, if a patent license would not permit royalty\\-free redistribution of the library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the library\\. if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances\\. it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices\\. many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\\. this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license\\. if the distribution and\\/or use of the library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyright ed interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the library under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\\. in such case, this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license\\. the free software foundation may publish revised and\\/or new versions of the library general public license from time to time\\. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns\\. each version is given a distinguishing version number\\. if the library specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation\\. if the library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation\\. if you wish to incorporate parts of the library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission\\. for software which is copyright ed by the free software foundation, write to the free software foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this\\. our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally\\. no warranty because the library is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the library, to the extent permitted by applicable law\\. except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and\\/or other parties provide the library \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the library is with you\\. should the library prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction\\. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and\\/or redistribute the library as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the library \\(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the library to operate with any other software\\), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"GNU Library General Public License v2

developer in \\(a\\) the source code, and \\(b\\) in any notice in an executable version or related documentation in which you describe the origin or ownership of the covered code\\. 3\\.4\\. intellectual property matters\\. third party claims\\. if contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party\"s intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights granted by such contributor under sections 2\\.1 or 2\\.2, contributor must include a text file with the source code distribution titled \"legal\" which describes the claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to contact\\. if contributor obtains such knowledge after the modification is made available as described in section 3\\.2, contributor shall promptly modify the legal file in all copies contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps \\(such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups\\) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the covered code that new knowledge has been obtained\\. contributor apis\\. if contributor\"s modifications include an application programming interface and contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that api, contributor must also include this information in the legal file\\. representations\\. contributor represents that,

rights to grant the rights conveyed by this license\\. 3\\.5\\. required notices\\. you must duplicate the notice in exhibit a in each file of the source code\\. if it is not possible to put such notice in a particular source code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location \\(such as a relevant directory\\) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice\\. if you created one or more modification\\(s\\) you may add your name as a contributor to the notice described in exhibit a\\. you must also duplicate this license in any documentation for the source code where you describe recipients\" rights or ownership rights relating to covered code\\. you may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of covered code\\. however, you may do so only on your own behalf, and not on behalf of the initial developer or any contributor\\. 3\\.6\\. distribution of executable versions\\. you may distribute covered code in executable form only if the requirements of section 3\\.1\\-3\\.5 have been met for that covered code\\. you may distribute the executable version of covered code or ownership rights under a license of your choice, which may contain terms different from this license, provided that you are in compliance with the terms of this license and that the license for the executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient\"s rights in the source code version from the rights set forth in this license\\. if you distribute the executable version under a different license you must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this license are offered by you alone, not by the initial developer or any contributor\\. if you distribute executable versions containing covered code as part of a product, you must reproduce the notice in exhibit b in the documentation and\\/or other materials provided with the product\\. 3\\.7\\. larger works\\. you may create a larger work by combining covered code with other code not governed by the terms of this license and distribute the larger work as a single product\\. in such a case, you must make sure the requirements of this license are fulfillled for the covered code\\. 3\\.8\\. restrictions\\. you may not remove any product identification, copyright , proprietary notices or labels from gsoap\\. 4 inability to comply due to statute or regulation\\. if it is impossible for you to comply with any of the terms of this license with respect to some or all of the covered code due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then you must: \\(a\\) comply with the terms of this license to the maximum extent possible; and \\(b\\) describe the limitations and the code they affect\\. such description must be included in the legal file described in section 3\\.4 and must be included with all distributions of the source code\\. except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it\\. 5 application of this license\\. this license

and\\/or new versions of the license from time to time\\. each version will be given a distinguishing version number\\. 6\\.2\\. effect of new versions\\. once covered code has been published under a particular version of the license, you may always continue to use it under the terms of that version\\. you may also choose to use such covered code under the terms of any subsequent version of the license\\. 6\\.3\\. derivative works\\. if you create or use a modified version of this license \\(which you may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already covered code governed by this license\\), you must \\(a\\) rename your license so that the phrase \"gsoap\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your license \\(except to note that you license differs from this

directly or indirectly in physical injury or loss of human life\\. this disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this license\\. no use of any covered code is authorized hereunder except under this disclaimer\\. 8 termination\\. 8\\.1\\. this license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if you fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach\\. all sublicenses to the covered code which are properly granted shall survive any termination of this license\\. provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this license shall survive\\. 8\\.2\\. 8\\.3\\. if you assert a patent infringement claim against participant alleging that such participant\"s contributor version directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved \\(such as by license or settlement\\) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such participant under sections 2\\.1 or 2\\.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license\\. 8\\.4\\. in the event of termination under sections 8\\.1 or 8\\.2 above, all end user license agreements \\(excluding distributors and resellers\\) which have been validly granted by you or any distributor hereunder

with this copyright and no\\-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation\\. if only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of the independent jpeg group\"\\. permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept no liability for damages of any kind\\. these conditions apply to any software derived from or based

distribution by permission of l\\. peter deutsch, sole proprietor of its copyright holder, aladdin enterprises of menlo park, ca\\. ansi2knr\\.c is not covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead by the usual distribution terms of the free software foundation; principally, that you must include source code if you redistribute it\\. \\(see the file ansi2knr\\.c for full details\\.\\) however, since ansi2knr\\.c is not needed as part of any program generated from the ijg code, this does not limit you more than the foregoing paragraphs do\\. the unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with gnu autoconf\\. it is copyright by the free software foundation but is freely distributable\\. the same holds for its supporting scripts \\(config\\.guess, config\\.sub, ltconfig, ltmain\\.sh\\)\\. another support script, install\\-sh, is copyright by m\\.i\\.t\\. but is also freely distributable\\. it appears that the arithmetic coding option of the jpeg spec is covered by patents owned by ibm, at&t, and mitsubishi\\. hence arithmetic coding cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses\\. for this reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free jpeg software\\. \\(since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it\\.\\) so far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining code\\. the ijg distribution formerly included code to read and write gif files\\. to avoid entanglement with the unisys lzw patent, gif reading support has been removed altogether, and the gif writer has been simplified to produce \"uncompressed gifs\"\\. this technique does not use the lzw algorithm; the resulting gif files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard gif decoders\\. we are required to state that \"the graphics interchange format copyright is the copyright property of compuserve incorporated\\. gif\\(sm\\) is a service mark property of compuserve incorporated\\.\"","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"Intel ACPI Software License

verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not allowed\\. preamble ======== the latex project public license \\(lppl\\) is the primary license under which the the latex kernel and the base latex packages are distributed\\. you may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute\\. this license may be particularly suitable if your work is tex\\-related \\(such as a latex package\\), but you may use it with small modifications even if your work is unrelated to tex\\. the section `whether and how to distribute works under this license\", below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license\\. this license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may be distributed\\. we, the latex3 project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work\\. if you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide\\.tex\" and `modguide\\.tex\" in the base latex distribution for suggestions\\. definitions =========== in this license document the following terms are used: `work\" any work being distributed under this license\\. `derived work\" any work that under any applicable law is derived from the work\\. `modification\" any procedure that produces a derived work under any applicable law \\-\\- for example, the production of a file containing an original file associated with the work or a significant portion of such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and\\/or translated into another language\\. `modify\" to apply any procedure that produces a derived work under any applicable law\\. `distribution\" making copies of the work available from one person to another, in whole or in part\\. distribution includes \\(but is not limited to\\) making any electronic components of the work accessible by file transfer protocols such as ftp or http or by shared file systems such as sun\"s network file system \\(nfs\\)\\. `compiled work\" a version of the work that has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system\\. this processing may include using installation facilities provided by the work, transformations of the work, copying of components of the work, or other activities\\. note that modification of any installation facilities provided by the work constitutes modification of the work\\. `current maintainer\" a person or persons nominated as such within the work\\. if there is no such explicit nomination then it is the ` copyright holder\" under any applicable law\\. `base interpreter\" a program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the work\\. a base interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the base interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively\\. unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the work, the only applicable base interpreter is a \"latex\\-format\"\\. conditions on distribution and modification =========================================== activities other than distribution and\\/or modification of the work are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope\\. in particular, the act of running the work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the work\\. you may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the work as you received it\\. distribution of only part of the work is considered modification of the work, and no right to distribute such a derived work may be assumed under the terms of this clause\\. you may distribute a compiled work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of the work as distributed under clause 2 above, as long as that compiled work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the compiled work on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they generated a compiled work directly from the work\\. if you are the current maintainer of the work, you may, without restriction, modify the work, thus creating a derived work\\. you may also distribute the derived work without restriction, including compiled works generated from the derived work\\. derived works distributed in this manner by the current maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the work\\. if you are not the current maintainer of the work, you may modify your copy of the work, thus creating a derived work based on the work, and compile this derived work, thus creating a compiled work based on the derived work\\. if you are not the current maintainer of the work, you may distribute a derived work provided the following conditions are met for every component of the work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition\\. only the current maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component of the work\\. if a component of this derived work can be a direct replacement for a component of the work when that component is used with the base interpreter, then, wherever this component of the work identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that base interpreter, the replacement component of this derived work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this component to the user when used interactively with that base interpreter\\. every component of the derived work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of the derived work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes\\. no information in the derived work implies that any persons, including \\(but not limited to\\) the authors of the original version of the work, provide any support, including \\(but not limited to\\) the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the derived work unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the derived work\\. you distribute at least one of the following with the derived work: a complete, unmodified copy of the work; if your distribution of a modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the work from the same or some similar place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the work along with the modified component; information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the work\\. if you are not the current maintainer of the work, you may distribute a compiled work generated from a derived work, as long as the derived work is distributed to all recipients of the compiled work, and as long as the conditions of clause 6, above, are met with regard to the derived work\\. the conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the work as it is distributed by the current maintainer under clause 4, above\\. distribution of the work or any derived work in an alternative format, where the work or that derived work \\(in whole or in part\\) is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process\\. a derived work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in clause 6 above, in regard to the work, though it does not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this license\\. if a derived work is distributed under this license, that derived work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that derived work to honor the restrictions in clause 6 above, concerning changes from the work\\. this license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the work by any means\\. nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws\\. no warranty =========== there is no warranty for the work\\. except when otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holder provides the work `as is\", without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the work is with you\\. should the work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction\\. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will the copyright holder, or any author named in the components of the work, or any other party who may distribute and\\/or modify the work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the work or out of inability to use the work \\(including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the work to operate with any other programs\\), even if the copyright holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\. maintenance of the work ======================= the work has the status `author\\-maintained\" if the copyright holder explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the work that the work can only be maintained by the copyright holder or simply that is `author\\-maintained\"\\. the work has the status `maintained\" if there is a current maintainer who has indicated in the work that they are willing to receive error reports for the work \\(for example, by supplying a valid e\\-mail address\\)\\. it is not required for the current maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports\\. the work changes from status `maintained\" to `unmaintained\" if there is no current maintainer, or the person stated to be current maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance\\. you can become the current maintainer of the work by agreement with any existing current maintainer to take over this role\\. if the work is unmaintained, you can become the current maintainer of the work through the following steps: make a reasonable attempt to trace the current maintainer \\(and the copyright holder, if the two differ\\) through the means of an internet or similar search\\. if this search is successful, then enquire whether the work is still maintained\\. if it is being maintained, then ask the current maintainer to update their communication data within one month\\. if the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the current maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance\\. \\(if the work is a latex work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp\\.text\\.tex\\.\\) 3a\\. if the current maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the work to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement\\. if the current maintainer is not reachable and the copyright holder agrees that maintenance of the work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement\\. if you make an `intention announcement\" as described in 2b\\. above and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the current maintainer nor by the copyright holder nor by other people, then you may arrange for the work to be changed so as to name you as the \\(new\\) current maintainer\\. if the previously unreachable current maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b\\) or 4\\), then that current maintainer must become or remain the current maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month\\. a change in the current maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the work is distributed under the lppl license\\. if you become the current maintainer of the work, you should immediately provide, within the work, a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as current maintainer\\. you should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b\\) above\\. whether and how to distribute works under this license ====================================================== this section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license\\. these authors are addressed as `you\" in this section\\. choosing this license or another license \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- if for any part of your work you want or need to use \\*distribution\\* conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute your work under a different license\\. you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the lppl\\. the document `modguide\\.tex\" in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license\\. it explains, for example, why distributing latex under the gnu general public license \\(gpl\\) was considered inappropriate\\. even if your work is unrelated to latex, the discussion in `modguide\\.tex\" may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it\\. a recommendation on modification without distribution \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- it is wise never to modify a component of the work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component\\. while you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident \\-\\- you may forget that you have modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse, cause problems for the community\\. it is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the work identical with the public one\\. many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components\\. how to use this license \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- to use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and\\/or last substantially modified\\. include also a statement that the distribution and\\/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license\\. here is an example of such a notice and statement: pig\\.dtx copyright 2003 m\\. y\\. name this work may be distributed and\\/or modified under the conditions of the latex project public license, either version 1\\.3 of this license or \\(at your option\\) any later version\\. the latest version of this license is in % http:\\/\\/www\\.latex\\-project\\.org\\/lppl\\.txt and version 1\\.3 or later is part of all distributions of latex version 2003\\/12\\/01 or later\\. this work has the lppl maintenance status \"maintained\"\\. this current maintainer of this work is m\\. y\\. name\\. this work consists of the files pig\\.dtx and pig\\.ins % and the derived file pig\\.sty\\. given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with the `work\" referring to the three files `pig\\.dtx\", `pig\\.ins\", and `pig\\.sty\" \\(the last being generated from `pig\\.dtx\" using `pig\\.ins\"\\), the `base interpreter\" referring to any \"latex\\-format\", and both ` copyright holder\" and `current maintainer\" referring to the person `m\\. y\\. name\"\\. if you do not want the maintenance section of lppl to apply to your work, change \"maintained\" above into \"author\\-maintained\"\\. however, we recommend that you use \"maintained\" as the maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself\\. important recommendations \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- defining what constitutes the work the lppl requires that distributions of the work contain all the files of the work\\. it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the work\\. this could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as: this work consists of all files listed in manifest\\.txt\\. in that place\\. in the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the work\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"LaTeX Project Public License

gives terms under which files of the program may be distributed and modified\\. individual files may have specific further constraints on modification, but no file should have restrictions on

does not need to check every file in the program for extra restrictions\\. if you do need to modify the distribution terms of some files, do not refer to this license, instead distribute the program

program is distributed under the lppl\\. the latex project public license ================================ terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification =============================================================== warranty ======== there is no warranty for the program, to the extent permitted by applicable law\\. except when otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holder provides the program `as is\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you\\. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction\\. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will the copyright holder, or any of the individual authors named in the source for the program, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the program or out of inability to use the program \\(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or by third parties as a result of a failure of the program to operate with any other programs\\), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\. distribution ============ redistribution of unchanged files is allowed provided that all files that make up the distribution of the program are distributed\\. in particular this means that the program has to be distributed including its documentation if documentation was part of the original distribution\\. the distribution of the program will contain a prominent file listing all the files covered by this license\\. if you receive only some of these files from someone, complain! the distribution of changed versions of certain files included in the the program, and the reuse of code from the program, are allowed under the following restrictions: it is allowed only if the legal notice in the file does not expressly forbid it\\. see note below, under \"conditions on individual files\"\\. you rename the file before you make any changes to it, unless the file explicitly says that renaming is not required\\. any such changed files must be distributed under a license that forbids distribution of those files, and any files derived from them, under the names used by the original files in the distribution of the program\\. you change any `identification string\" in the program to clearly indicate that the file is not part of the standard system\\. if the program includes an `error report address\" so that errors may be reported to the copyright holder, or other specified addresses, this address must be changed in any modified versions of the program, so that reports for files not maintained by the original program maintainers are directed to the maintainers of the changed files\\. you acknowledge the source and authorship of the original version in the modified file\\. you also distribute the unmodified version of the file or alternatively provide sufficient information so that the user of your modified file can be reasonably expected to be able to obtain an original, unmodified copy of the program\\. for example, you may specify a url to a site that you expect will freely provide the user with a copy of the program \\(either the version on which your modification is based, or perhaps a later version\\)\\. if the program is intended to be used with, or is based on, latex, then files with the following file extensions which have special meaning in latex software, have special modification rules under the license: files with extension `\\.ins\" \\(installation files\\): these files may not be modified at all because they contain the legal notices that are placed in the generated files\\. files with extension `\\.fd\" \\(latex font definitions files\\): these files are allowed to be modified without changing the name, but only to enable use of all available fonts and to prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts\\. however, modified files are not allowed to be distributed in place of original files\\. files with extension `\\.cfg\" \\(configuration files\\): these files can be created or modified to enable easy configuration of the system\\. the documentation in cfgguide\\.tex in the base latex distribution describes when it makes sense to modify or generate such files\\. the above restrictions are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file in the program\\. ======================================================================== notes ===== we believe that these requirements give you the freedom you to make modifications that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish, while maintaining the availability, integrity and reliability of the program\\. if you do not see how to achieve your goal while adhering to these requirements then read the document cfgguide\\.tex in the base latex distribution for suggestions\\. because of the portability and exchangeability aspects of systems like latex, the latex3 project deprecates the distribution of non\\-standard versions of components of latex or of generally available contributed code for them but such distributions are permitted under the above restrictions\\. the document modguide\\.tex in the base latex distribution details the reasons for the legal requirements detailed above\\. even if the program is unrelated to latex, the argument in modguide\\.tex may still apply, and should be read before a modified version of the program is distributed\\. conditions on individual files ============================== the individual files may bear additional conditions which supersede the general conditions on distribution and modification contained in this file\\. if there are any such files, the distribution of the program will contain a prominent file that lists all the exceptional files\\. typical examples of files with more restrictive modification conditions would be files that contain the text of copyright notices\\. the conditions on individual files differ only in the extent of \\*modification\\* that is allowed\\. the conditions on \\*distribution\\* are the same for all the files\\. thus a \\(re\\)distributor of a complete, unchanged copy of the program need meet only the conditions in this file; it is not necessary to check the header of every file in the distribution to check that a distribution meets these requirements\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"LaTeX Project Public License v1.1","identifier":"LPPL-1.1","url":["http://www.latex-project.org/lppl/lppl-1-1.txt"],"header":"Copyright [YEAR] [NAME]\n

recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license\\. in this license document, `the program\" refers to any program distributed under this license\\. this license gives conditions under which the program may be distributed and conditions under which modified versions of the program may be distributed\\. individual files of the program may bear supplementary and\\/or superseding conditions on modification of themselves and on the distribution of modified versions of themselves, but \\*no\\* file of the program may bear supplementary or superseding conditions on the distribution of an unmodified copy of the file\\. a distributor wishing to distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the program therefore needs to check the conditions only in this license and nowhere else\\. activities other than distribution and\\/or modification of the program are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope\\. in particular, the act of running the program is not restricted\\. we, the latex3 project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of the program that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of the program\\. if you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide\\.tex\" in the base latex distribution for suggestions\\. conditions on distribution and modification =========================================== you may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the program\\. distribution of only part of the program is not allowed\\. you may not modify in any way a file of the program that bears a legal notice forbidding modification of that file\\. you may distribute a modified file of the program if, and only if, the following eight conditions are met: you must meet any additional conditions borne by the file on the distribution of a modified version of the file as described below in the subsection `additional conditions on individual files of the program\"\\. if the file is a latex software file, then you must meet any applicable additional conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file that are described below in the subsection `additional conditions on latex software files\"\\. you must not distribute the modified file with the filename of the original file\\. in the modified file, you must acknowledge the authorship and name of the original file, and the name \\(if any\\) of the program which contains it\\. you must change any identification string in the file to indicate clearly that the modified file is not part of the program\\. you must change any addresses in the modified file for the reporting of errors in the file or in the program generally to ensure that reports for files no longer maintained by the original maintainers will be directed to the maintainers of the modified files\\. you must distribute the modified file under a license that forbids distribution both of the modified file and of any files derived from the modified file with the filename of the original file\\. you must do either \\(a\\) or \\(b\\): distribute a copy of the program \\(that is, a complete, unmodified copy of the program\\) together with the modified file; if your distribution of the modified file is made by offering access to copy the modified file from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the program from the same place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the program along with the modified file; provide to those who receive the modified file information that is sufficient for them to obtain a copy of the program; for example, you may provide a uniform resource locator \\(url\\) for a site that you expect will provide them with a copy of the program free of charge \\(either the version from which your modification is derived, or perhaps a later version\\)\\. note that in the above, `distribution\" of a file means making the file available to others by any means\\. this includes, for instance, installing the file on any machine in such a way that the file is accessible by users other than yourself\\. `modification\" of a file means any procedure that produces a derivative file under any applicable law \\-\\- that is, a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\\/or translated into another language\\. changing the name of a file is considered to be a modification of the file\\. the distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions\\. note, however, that condition 7\\. does apply to any such modified file\\. the conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of the program\\. a recommendation on modification without distribution \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- it is wise never to modify a file of the

\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- an individual file of the program may bear additional conditions that supplement and\\/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file\\. the conditions on individual files of the program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files\\. additional conditions on latex software files \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- if a file of the program is intended to be used with latex \\(that is, if it is a latex software file\\), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and\\/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename extension: you may not modify any file with filename extension `\\.ins\" since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate\\. you may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `\\.fd\" \\(latex font definition files\\) under the standard conditions of the lppl as described above\\. you may also distribute such modified latex font definition files with their original names provided that: the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts; you also distribute the original, unmodified files \\(tex input paths can be used to control which set of latex font definition files is actually used by tex\\)\\. you may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `\\.cfg\" \\(configuration files\\) with their original names\\. the program may \\(and usually will\\) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file\\. because of portability and exchangeability issues in latex software, the latex3 project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of latex or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license\\. no warranty =========== there is no warranty for the program\\. except when otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holder provides the program `as is\", without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you\\. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction\\. in no event unless agreed to in writing will the copyright holder, or any author named in the files of the program, or any other party who may distribute and\\/or modify the program as permitted below, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the program or out of inability to use the program \\(including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the program to operate with any other programs\\), even if the copyright holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\. whether and how to distribute programs under this license ========================================================= this section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under

\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- if for any part of your program you want or need to use \\*distribution\\* conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license\\. you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the lppl\\. the document `modguide\\.tex\" in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license\\. it explains, for example, why distributing latex under the gnu general public license

program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and\\/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license\\. here is an example of such a notice and statement: pig\\.dtx copyright 2001 m\\. y\\. name this program may be distributed and\\/or modified under the conditions of the latex project public

program contain all the files of the program\\. it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the program\\. this could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like this program consists of all files listed in manifest\\.txt\\. in that place\\. in the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the program\\. noting exceptional files if the program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those files \\(other than those listed in `additional conditions on latex software files\"\\), then it is recommended that the program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files\\. files containing the text of a license \\(such as this file\\) are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification\\. latex configuration files \\(with filename extension `\\.cfg\"\\) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file\\. the additional conditions on latex software given

derivative file under any applicable law \\-\\- that is, a file containing the original file or a significant portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and\\/or translated into another language\\. changing the name of a file \\(other than as necessitated by the file conventions of the target file systems\\) is considered to be a modification of the file\\. the distribution conditions in this license do not have to be applied to files that have been modified in accordance with the above conditions\\. note, however, that condition 7\\. does apply to any such modified file\\. the conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the updating, by any method, of a file so that it becomes identical to the latest version of that file of the program\\. a recommendation on modification without distribution \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- it is wise never to modify a file of the program, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above eight conditions for distributing the modified file\\. while you might intend that such modified files will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident \\-\\- you may forget that you have modified the file; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified file that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license\\. it is usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the program identical with the public one\\. many programs provide ways to control the behavior of that program without altering its licensed files\\. additional conditions on individual files of the program \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- an individual file of the program may bear additional conditions that supplement and\\/or supersede the conditions in this license if, and only if, such additional conditions exclusively concern modification of the file or distribution of a modified version of the file\\. the conditions on individual files of the program therefore may differ only with respect to the kind and extent of modification of those files that is allowed, and with respect to the distribution of modified versions of those files\\. additional conditions on latex software files \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- if a file of the program is intended to be used with latex \\(that is, if it is a latex software file\\), then the following additional conditions, which supplement and\\/or supersede the conditions above, apply to the file according to its filename extension: you may not modify any file with filename extension `\\.ins\" since these are installation files containing the legal notices that are placed in the files they generate\\. you may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `\\.fd\" \\(latex font definition files\\) under the standard conditions of the lppl as described above\\. you may also distribute such modified latex font definition files with their original names provided that: the only changes to the original files either enable use of available fonts or prevent attempts to access unavailable fonts; you also distribute the original, unmodified files \\(tex input paths can be used to control which set of latex font definition files is actually used by tex\\)\\. you may distribute modified versions of files with filename extension `\\.cfg\" \\(configuration files\\) with their original names\\. the program may \\(and usually will\\) specify the range of commands that are allowed in a particular configuration file\\. because of portability and exchangeability issues in latex software, the latex3 project deprecates the distribution of modified versions of components of latex or of generally available contributed code for them, but such distribution can meet the conditions of this license\\. no warranty =========== there is no warranty for the program\\. except when otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holder provides the program `as is\", without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the program is with you\\. should the program prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction\\. in no event unless agreed to in writing will the copyright holder, or any author named in the files of the program, or any other party who may distribute and\\/or modify the program as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the program or out of inability to use the program \\(including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the program to operate with any other programs\\), even if the copyright holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\. whether and how to distribute programs under this license ========================================================= this section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their programs under this license\\. these authors are addressed as `you\" in this section\\. choosing this license or another license \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- if for any part of your program you want or need to use \\*distribution\\* conditions that differ from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your program but instead distribute your program under a different license\\. you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your program is distributed under the lppl\\. the document `modguide\\.tex\" in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license\\. it explains, for example, why distributing latex under the gnu general public license \\(gpl\\) was considered inappropriate\\. even if your program is unrelated to latex, the discussion in `modguide\\.tex\" may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their programs under any license are encouraged to read it\\. how to use this license \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- to use this license, place in each of the files of your program both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year and also a statement that the distribution and\\/or modification of the file is constrained by the conditions in this license\\. here is an example of such a notice and statement: pig\\.dtx copyright 2001 m\\. y\\. name this program may be distributed and\\/or modified under the conditions of the latex project public license, either version 1\\.2 of this license or \\(at your option\\) any later version\\. the latest version of this license is in http:\\/\\/www\\.latex\\-project\\.org\\/lppl\\.txt and version 1\\.2 or later is part of all distributions of latex version 1999\\/12\\/01 or later\\. this program consists of the files pig\\.dtx and pig\\.ins given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with `the program\" referring to the two files `pig\\.dtx\" and `pig\\.ins\", and `the copyright holder\" referring to the person `m\\. y\\. name\"\\. important recommendations \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- defining what constitutes the program the lppl requires that distributions of the program contain all the files of the program\\. it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the program\\. this could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the program near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line like this program consists of all files listed in manifest\\.txt\\. in that place\\. in the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the program\\. noting exceptional files if the program contains any files bearing additional conditions on modification, or on distribution of modified versions, of those files \\(other than those listed in `additional conditions on latex software files\"\\), then it is recommended that the program contain a prominent file that defines the exceptional conditions, and either lists the exceptional files or defines one or more categories of exceptional files\\. files containing the text of a license \\(such as this file\\) are often examples of files bearing more restrictive conditions on modification\\. latex configuration files \\(with filename extension `\\.cfg\"\\) are examples of files bearing less restrictive conditions on the distribution of a modified version of the file\\. the additional conditions on latex software given above are examples of declaring a category of files bearing exceptional additional conditions\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"LaTeX Project Public License

2008\\-05\\-04 copyright 1999 2002\\-2008 latex3 project everyone is allowed to distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but modification of it is not allowed\\. preamble ======== the latex project public license \\(lppl\\) is the primary license under which the latex kernel and the base latex packages are distributed\\. you may use this license for any work of which you hold the copyright and which you wish to distribute\\. this license may be particularly suitable if your work is tex\\-related \\(such as a latex package\\), but it is written in such a way that you can use it even if your work is unrelated to tex\\. the section `whether and how to distribute works under this license\", below, gives instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license\\. this license gives conditions under which a work may be distributed and modified, as well as conditions under which modified versions of that work may be distributed\\. we, the latex3 project, believe that the conditions below give you the freedom to make and distribute modified versions of your work that conform with whatever technical specifications you wish while maintaining the availability, integrity, and reliability of that work\\. if you do not see how to achieve your goal while meeting these conditions, then read the document `cfgguide\\.tex\" and `modguide\\.tex\" in the base latex distribution for suggestions\\. definitions =========== in this license document the following terms are used: `work\" any work being distributed under this license\\. `derived work\" any work that under any applicable law is derived from the work\\. `modification\" any procedure that produces a derived work under any applicable law \\-\\- for example, the production of a file containing an original file associated with the work or a significant portion of such a file, either verbatim or with modifications and\\/or translated into another language\\. `modify\" to apply any procedure that produces a derived work under any applicable law\\. `distribution\" making copies of the work available from one person to another, in whole or in part\\. distribution includes \\(but is not limited to\\) making any electronic components of the work accessible by file transfer protocols such as ftp or http or by shared file systems such as sun\"s network file system \\(nfs\\)\\. `compiled work\" a version of the work that has been processed into a form where it is directly usable on a computer system\\. this processing may include using installation facilities provided by the work, transformations of the work, copying of components of the work, or other activities\\. note that modification of any installation facilities provided by the work constitutes modification of the work\\. `current maintainer\" a person or persons nominated as such within the work\\. if there is no such explicit nomination then it is the ` copyright holder\" under any applicable law\\. `base interpreter\" a program or process that is normally needed for running or interpreting a part or the whole of the work\\. a base interpreter may depend on external components but these are not considered part of the base interpreter provided that each external component clearly identifies itself whenever it is used interactively\\. unless explicitly specified when applying the license to the work, the only applicable base interpreter is a `latex\\-format\" or in the case of files belonging to the `latex\\-format\" a program implementing the `tex language\"\\. conditions on distribution and modification =========================================== activities other than distribution and\\/or modification of the work are not covered by this license; they are outside its scope\\. in particular, the act of running the work is not restricted and no requirements are made concerning any offers of support for the work\\. you may distribute a complete, unmodified copy of the work as you received it\\. distribution of only part of the work is considered modification of the work, and no right to distribute such a derived work may be assumed under the terms of this clause\\. you may distribute a compiled work that has been generated from a complete, unmodified copy of the work as distributed under clause 2 above, as long as that compiled work is distributed in such a way that the recipients may install the compiled work on their system exactly as it would have been installed if they generated a compiled work directly from the work\\. if you are the current maintainer of the work, you may, without restriction, modify the work, thus creating a derived work\\. you may also distribute the derived work without restriction, including compiled works generated from the derived work\\. derived works distributed in this manner by the current maintainer are considered to be updated versions of the work\\. if you are not the current maintainer of the work, you may modify your copy of the work, thus creating a derived work based on the work, and compile this derived work, thus creating a compiled work based on the derived work\\. if you are not the current maintainer of the work, you may distribute a derived work provided the following conditions are met for every component of the work unless that component clearly states in the copyright notice that it is exempt from that condition\\. only the current maintainer is allowed to add such statements of exemption to a component of the work\\. if a component of this derived work can be a direct replacement for a component of the work when that component is used with the base interpreter, then, wherever this component of the work identifies itself to the user when used interactively with that base interpreter, the replacement component of this derived work clearly and unambiguously identifies itself as a modified version of this component to the user when used interactively with that base interpreter\\. every component of the derived work contains prominent notices detailing the nature of the changes to that component, or a prominent reference to another file that is distributed as part of the derived work and that contains a complete and accurate log of the changes\\. no information in the derived work implies that any persons, including \\(but not limited to\\) the authors of the original version of the work, provide any support, including \\(but not limited to\\) the reporting and handling of errors, to recipients of the derived work unless those persons have stated explicitly that they do provide such support for the derived work\\. you distribute at least one of the following with the derived work: a complete, unmodified copy of the work; if your distribution of a modified component is made by offering access to copy the modified component from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the work from the same or some similar place meets this condition, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the work along with the modified component; information that is sufficient to obtain a complete, unmodified copy of the work\\. if you are not the current maintainer of the work, you may distribute a compiled work generated from a derived work, as long as the derived work is distributed to all recipients of the compiled work, and as long as the conditions of clause 6, above, are met with regard to the derived work\\. the conditions above are not intended to prohibit, and hence do not apply to, the modification, by any method, of any component so that it becomes identical to an updated version of that component of the work as it is distributed by the current maintainer under clause 4, above\\. distribution of the work or any derived work in an alternative format, where the work or that derived work \\(in whole or in part\\) is then produced by applying some process to that format, does not relax or nullify any sections of this license as they pertain to the results of applying that process\\. a derived work may be distributed under a different license provided that license itself honors the conditions listed in clause 6 above, in regard to the work, though it does not have to honor the rest of the conditions in this license\\. if a derived work is distributed under a different license, that derived work must provide sufficient documentation as part of itself to allow each recipient of that derived work to honor the restrictions in clause 6 above, concerning changes from the work\\. this license places no restrictions on works that are unrelated to the work, nor does this license place any restrictions on aggregating such works with the work by any means\\. nothing in this license is intended to, or may be used to, prevent complete compliance by all parties with all applicable laws\\. no warranty =========== there is no warranty for the work\\. except when otherwise stated in writing, the copyright holder provides the work `as is\", without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the work is with you\\. should the work prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction\\. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will the copyright holder, or any author named in the components of the work, or any other party who may distribute and\\/or modify the work as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of any use of the work or out of inability to use the work \\(including, but not limited to, loss of data, data being rendered inaccurate, or losses sustained by anyone as a result of any failure of the work to operate with any other programs\\), even if the copyright holder or said author or said other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\. maintenance of the work ======================= the work has the status `author\\-maintained\" if the copyright holder explicitly and prominently states near the primary copyright notice in the work that the work can only be maintained by the copyright holder or simply that it is `author\\-maintained\"\\. the work has the status `maintained\" if there is a current maintainer who has indicated in the work that they are willing to receive error reports for the work \\(for example, by supplying a valid e\\-mail address\\)\\. it is not required for the current maintainer to acknowledge or act upon these error reports\\. the work changes from status `maintained\" to `unmaintained\" if there is no current maintainer, or the person stated to be current maintainer of the work cannot be reached through the indicated means of communication for a period of six months, and there are no other significant signs of active maintenance\\. you can become the current maintainer of the work by agreement with any existing current maintainer to take over this role\\. if the work is unmaintained, you can become the current maintainer of the work through the following steps: make a reasonable attempt to trace the current maintainer \\(and the copyright holder, if the two differ\\) through the means of an internet or similar search\\. if this search is successful, then enquire whether the work is still maintained\\. if it is being maintained, then ask the current maintainer to update their communication data within one month\\. if the search is unsuccessful or no action to resume active maintenance is taken by the current maintainer, then announce within the pertinent community your intention to take over maintenance\\. \\(if the work is a latex work, this could be done, for example, by posting to comp\\.text\\.tex\\.\\) 3a\\. if the current maintainer is reachable and agrees to pass maintenance of the work to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement\\. if the current maintainer is not reachable and the copyright holder agrees that maintenance of the work be passed to you, then this takes effect immediately upon announcement\\. if you make an `intention announcement\" as described in 2b\\. above and after three months your intention is challenged neither by the current maintainer nor by the copyright holder nor by other people, then you may arrange for the work to be changed so as to name you as the \\(new\\) current maintainer\\. if the previously unreachable current maintainer becomes reachable once more within three months of a change completed under the terms of 3b\\) or 4\\), then that current maintainer must become or remain the current maintainer upon request provided they then update their communication data within one month\\. a change in the current maintainer does not, of itself, alter the fact that the work is distributed under the lppl license\\. if you become the current maintainer of the work, you should immediately provide, within the work, a prominent and unambiguous statement of your status as current maintainer\\. you should also announce your new status to the same pertinent community as in 2b\\) above\\. whether and how to distribute works under this license ====================================================== this section contains important instructions, examples, and recommendations for authors who are considering distributing their works under this license\\. these authors are addressed as `you\" in this section\\. choosing this license or another license \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- if for any part of your work you want or need to use \\*distribution\\* conditions that differ significantly from those in this license, then do not refer to this license anywhere in your work but, instead, distribute your work under a different license\\. you may use the text of this license as a model for your own license, but your license should not refer to the lppl or otherwise give the impression that your work is distributed under the lppl\\. the document `modguide\\.tex\" in the base latex distribution explains the motivation behind the conditions of this license\\. it explains, for example, why distributing latex under the gnu general public license \\(gpl\\) was considered inappropriate\\. even if your work is unrelated to latex, the discussion in `modguide\\.tex\" may still be relevant, and authors intending to distribute their works under any license are encouraged to read it\\. a recommendation on modification without distribution \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- it is wise never to modify a component of the work, even for your own personal use, without also meeting the above conditions for distributing the modified component\\. while you might intend that such modifications will never be distributed, often this will happen by accident \\-\\- you may forget that you have modified that component; or it may not occur to you when allowing others to access the modified version that you are thus distributing it and violating the conditions of this license in ways that could have legal implications and, worse, cause problems for the community\\. it is therefore usually in your best interest to keep your copy of the work identical with the public one\\. many works provide ways to control the behavior of that work without altering any of its licensed components\\. how to use this license \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- to use this license, place in each of the components of your work both an explicit copyright notice including your name and the year the work was authored and\\/or last substantially modified\\. include also a statement that the distribution and\\/or modification of that component is constrained by the conditions in this license\\. here is an example of such a notice and statement: pig\\.dtx copyright 2005 m\\. y\\. name this work may be distributed and\\/or modified under the conditions of the latex project public license, either version 1\\.3 of this license or \\(at your option\\) any later version\\. the latest version of this license is in http:\\/\\/www\\.latex\\-project\\.org\\/lppl\\.txt and version 1\\.3 or later is part of all distributions of latex version 2005\\/12\\/01 or later\\. this work has the lppl maintenance status `maintained\"\\. the current maintainer of this work is m\\. y\\. name\\. this work consists of the files pig\\.dtx and pig\\.ins and the derived file pig\\.sty\\. given such a notice and statement in a file, the conditions given in this license document would apply, with the `work\" referring to the three files `pig\\.dtx\", `pig\\.ins\", and `pig\\.sty\" \\(the last being generated from `pig\\.dtx\" using `pig\\.ins\"\\), the `base interpreter\" referring to any `latex\\-format\", and both ` copyright holder\" and `current maintainer\" referring to the person `m\\. y\\. name\"\\. if you do not want the maintenance section of lppl to apply to your work, change `maintained\" above into `author\\-maintained\"\\. however, we recommend that you use `maintained\", as the maintenance section was added in order to ensure that your work remains useful to the community even when you can no longer maintain and support it yourself\\. derived works that are not replacements \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- several clauses of the lppl specify means to provide reliability and stability for the user community\\. they therefore concern themselves with the case that a derived work is intended to be used as a \\(compatible or incompatible\\) replacement of the original work\\. if this is not the case \\(e\\.g\\., if a few lines of code are reused for a completely different task\\), then clauses 6b and 6d shall not apply\\. important recommendations \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- defining what constitutes the work the lppl requires that distributions of the work contain all the files of the work\\. it is therefore important that you provide a way for the licensee to determine which files constitute the work\\. this could, for example, be achieved by explicitly listing all the files of the work near the copyright notice of each file or by using a line such as: this work consists of all files listed in manifest\\.txt\\. in that place\\. in the absence of an unequivocal list it might be impossible for the licensee to determine what is considered by you to comprise the work and, in such a case, the licensee would be entitled to make reasonable conjectures as to which files comprise the work\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"Latex2e License","identifier":"Latex2e","url":["https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/licensing/latex2e"],"header":"","template":"permission is granted to make and

is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the linguistic resource\\. in addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the linguistic resource with the linguistic resource \\(or with a work based on the linguistic resource\\) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license\\. a program that contains no derivative of any portion of the linguistic resource, but is designed to work with the linguistic resource \\(or an encrypted form of the linguistic resource\\) by reading it or being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the linguistic resource\"\\. such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the linguistic resource, and therefore falls outside the scope of this license\\. however, combining a \"work that uses the linguistic resource\" with the linguistic resource \\(or an encrypted form of the linguistic resource\\) creates a package that is a derivative of the linguistic resource \\(because it contains portions of the linguistic resource\\), rather than a \"work that uses the linguistic resource\"\\. if the package is a derivative of the linguistic resource, you may distribute the package under the terms of section 4\\. any works containing that package also fall under section 4\\. as an exception to the sections above, you may also combine a \"work that uses the linguistic resource\" with the linguistic resource \\(or an encrypted form of the linguistic resource\\) to produce a package containing portions of the linguistic resource, and distribute that package under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the package for the customer\"s own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications\\. you must give prominent notice with each copy of the package that the linguistic resource is used in it and that the linguistic resource and its use are covered by this license\\. you must supply a copy of this license\\. if the package during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the linguistic resource among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this license\\. also, you must do one of these things: accompany the package with the complete corresponding machine\\-readable legible form of the linguistic resource including whatever changes were used in the package \\(which must be distributed under sections 1 and 2 above\\); and, if the package contains an encrypted form of the linguistic resource, with the complete machine\\-readable \"work that uses the linguistic resource\", as object code and\\/or source code, so that the user can modify the linguistic resource and then encrypt it to produce a modified package containing the modified linguistic resource\\. use a suitable mechanism for combining with the linguistic resource\\. a suitable mechanism is one that will operate properly with a modified version of the linguistic resource, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is interface\\-compatible with the version that the package was made with\\. accompany the package with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in subsection 4a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution\\. if distribution of the package is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place\\. verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy\\. if the package includes an encrypted form of the linguistic resource, the required form of the \"work that uses the linguistic resource\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the package from it\\. however, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed \\(in either source or binary form\\) with the major components \\(compiler, kernel, and so on\\) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable\\. it may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system\\. such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the linguistic resource together in a package that you distribute\\. you may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the linguistic resource except as expressly provided under this license\\. any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the linguistic resource is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this license\\. however, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance\\. you are not required to accept this license, since you have not signed it\\. however, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the linguistic resource or its derivative works\\. these actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this license\\. therefore, by modifying or distributing the linguistic resource \\(or any work based on the linguistic resource\\), you indicate your acceptance of this license to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the linguistic resource or works based on it\\. each time you redistribute the linguistic resource \\(or any work based on the linguistic resource\\), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the linguistic resource subject to these terms and conditions\\. you may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients\" exercise of the rights granted herein\\. you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license\\. if, as a consequence of a court judgement or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason \\(not limited to patent issues\\), conditions are imposed on you \\(whether by court order, agreement or otherwise\\) that contradict the conditions of this license, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this license\\. if you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this license and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the linguistic resource at all\\. for example, if a patent license would not permit royalty\\-free redistribution of the linguistic resource by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this license would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the linguistic resource\\. if any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances\\. it is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free resource distribution system which is implemented by public license practices\\. many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of data distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author\\/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute resources through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice\\. this section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this license\\. if the distribution and\\/or use of the linguistic resource is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyright ed interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the linguistic resource under this license may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded\\. in such case, this license incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this license\\. the free software foundation may publish revised and\\/or new versions of the lesser general public license for linguistic resources from time to time\\. such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns\\. each version is given a distinguishing version number\\. if the linguistic resource specifies a version number of this license which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the free software foundation\\. if the linguistic resource does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the free software foundation\\. if you wish to incorporate parts of the linguistic resource into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission\\. no warranty because the linguistic resource is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty for the linguistic resource, to the extent permitted by applicable law\\. except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and\\/or other parties provide the linguistic resource \"as is\" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\\. the entire risk as to the quality and performance of the linguistic resource is with you\\. should the linguistic resource prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction\\. in no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and\\/or redistribute the linguistic resource as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the linguistic resource \\(including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the linguistic resource to operate with any other software\\), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"libpng

part thereof, to be licensed at no charge to all third parties on terms identical to those contained in this license agreement \\(except that you may choose to grant more extensive warranty protection to some or all third parties, at your option\\) you may charge a distribution fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee\\. you may copy and distribute nethack \\(or a portion or derivative of it, under paragraph 2\\) in object code or executable form under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: accompany it with the complete machine\\-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of paragraphs 1 and 2 above; or, accompany it with full information as to how to obtain the complete machine\\-readable source code from an appropriate archive site\\. \\(this alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution\\.\\) for these purposes, complete source code means either the full source distribution as originally released over usenet or updated copies of the files in this distribution used to create the object code or

license \\(odbl\\) preamble the open database license \\(odbl\\) is a license agreement intended to allow users to freely share, modify, and use this database while maintaining this same freedom for others\\. many databases are covered by copyright , and therefore this document licenses these rights\\. some jurisdictions, mainly in the european union, have specific rights that cover databases, and so the odbl addresses these rights, too\\. finally, the odbl is also an agreement in contract for users of this database to act in certain ways in return for accessing this database\\. databases can contain a wide variety of types of content \\(images, audiovisual material, and sounds all in the same database, for example\\), and so the odbl only governs the rights over the database, and not the contents of the database individually\\. licensors should use the odbl together with another license for the contents, if the contents have a single set of rights that uniformly covers all of the contents\\. if the contents have multiple sets of different rights, licensors should describe what rights govern what contents together in the individual record or in some other way that clarifies what rights apply\\. sometimes the contents of a database, or the database itself, can be covered by other rights not addressed here \\(such as private contracts, trade mark over the name, or privacy rights \\/ data protection rights over information in the contents\\), and so you are advised that you may have to consult other documents or clear other rights before doing activities not covered by this license\\. \\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\- the licensor \\(as defined below\\) and you \\(as defined below\\) agree as follows: 1\\.0 definitions of capitalised words \"collective database\" \\- means this database in unmodified form as part of a collection of independent databases in themselves that together are assembled into a collective whole\\. a work that constitutes a collective database will not be considered a derivative database\\. \"convey\" \\- as a verb, means using the database, a derivative database, or the database as part of a collective database in any way that enables a person to make or receive copies of the database or a derivative database\\. conveying does not include interaction with a user through a computer network, or creating and using a produced work, where no transfer of a copy of the database or a derivative database occurs\\. \"contents\" \\- the contents of this database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the database\\. for example, the contents of the database could be factual data or works such as images, audiovisual material, text, or sounds\\. \"database\" \\- a collection of material \\(the contents\\) arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this license\\. \"database directive\" \\- means directive 96\\/9\\/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 11 march 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended or succeeded\\. \"database right\" \\- means rights resulting from the chapter iii \\(\"sui generis\"\\) rights in the database directive \\(as amended and as transposed by member states\\), which includes the extraction and re\\-utilization of the whole or a substantial part of the contents, as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under section 10\\.4\\. \"derivative database\" \\- means a database based upon the database, and includes any translation, adaptation, arrangement, modification, or any other alteration of the database or of a substantial part of the contents\\. this includes, but is not limited to, extracting or re\\-utilising the whole or a substantial part of the contents in a new database\\. \"extraction\" \\- means the permanent or temporary transfer of all or a substantial part of the contents to another medium by any means or in any form\\. \"license\" \\- means this license agreement and is both a license of rights such as copyright and database rights and an agreement in contract\\. \"licensor\" \\- means the person that offers the database under the terms of this license\\. \"person\" \\- means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate\\. \"produced work\" \\- a work \\(such as an image, audiovisual material, text, or sounds\\) resulting from using the whole or a substantial part of the contents \\(via a search or other query\\) from this database, a derivative database, or this database as part of a collective database\\. \"publicly\" \\- means to persons other than you or under your control by either more than 50% ownership or by the power to direct their activities \\(such as contracting with an independent consultant\\)\\. \"re\\-utilization\" \\- means any form of making available to the public all or a substantial part of the contents by the distribution of copies, by renting, by online or other forms of transmission\\. \"substantial\" \\- means substantial in terms of quantity or quality or a combination of both\\. the repeated and systematic extraction or re\\-utilization of insubstantial parts of the contents may amount to the extraction or re\\-utilization of a substantial part of the contents\\. \"use\" \\- as a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or database rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes without limitation distributing, copying, publicly performing, publicly displaying, and preparing derivative works of the database, as well as modifying the database as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format\\. \"you\" \\- means a person exercising rights under this license who has not previously violated the terms of this license with respect to the database, or who has received express permission from the licensor to exercise rights under this license despite a previous violation\\. words in the singular include the plural and vice versa\\. 2\\.0 what this license covers 2\\.1\\. legal effect of this document\\. this license is: a license of applicable copyright and neighbouring rights; a license of the database right; and an agreement in contract between you and the licensor\\. 2\\.2 legal rights covered\\. this license covers the legal rights in the database, including: copyright \\. any copyright or neighbouring rights in the database\\. the copyright licensed includes any individual elements of the database, but does not cover the copyright over the contents independent of this database\\. see section 2\\.4 for details\\. copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organization of the database, and can also include the database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the field names of contents stored in the database; database rights\\. database rights only extend to the extraction and re\\-utilization of the whole or a substantial part of the contents\\. database rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the database\\. database rights can also apply when the contents are removed from the database and are selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright ; and contract\\. this is an agreement between you and the licensor for access to the database\\. in return you agree to certain conditions of use on this access as outlined in this license\\. 2\\.3 rights not covered\\. this license does not apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the database; this license does not cover any patents over the contents or the database; and this license does not cover any trademarks associated with the database\\. 2\\.4 relationship to contents in the database\\. the individual items of the contents contained in this database may be covered by other rights, including copyright , patent, data protection, privacy, or personality rights, and this license does not cover any rights \\(other than database rights or in contract\\) in individual contents contained in the database\\. for example, if used on a database of images \\(the contents\\), this license would not apply to copyright over individual images, which could have their own separate licenses, or one single license covering all of the rights over the images\\. 3\\.0 rights granted 3\\.1 subject to the terms and conditions of this license, the licensor grants to you a worldwide, royalty\\-free, non\\-exclusive, terminable \\(but only under section 9\\) license to use the database for the duration of any applicable copyright and database rights\\. these rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour\\. to the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the future\\. the rights granted cover, for example: extraction and re\\-utilization of the whole or a substantial part of the contents; creation of derivative databases; creation of collective databases; creation of temporary or permanent reproductions by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any derivative databases or as a part of collective databases; and distribution, communication, display, lending, making available, or performance to the public by any means and in any form, in whole or in part, including of any derivative database or as a part of collective databases\\. 3\\.2 compulsory license schemes\\. for the avoidance of doubt: non\\-waivable compulsory license schemes\\. in those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by you of the rights granted under this license; waivable compulsory license schemes\\. in those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by you of the rights granted under this license; and, voluntary license schemes\\. the licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by you of the rights granted under this license\\. 3\\.3 the right to release the database under different terms, or to stop distributing or making available the database, is reserved\\. note that this database may be multiple\\-licensed, and so you may have the choice of using alternative licenses for this database\\. subject to section 10\\.4, all other rights not expressly granted by licensor are reserved\\. 4\\.0 conditions of use 4\\.1 the rights granted in section 3 above are expressly made subject to your complying with the following conditions of use\\. these are important conditions of this license, and if you fail to follow them, you will be in material breach of its terms\\. 4\\.2 notices\\. if you publicly convey this database, any derivative database, or the database as part of a collective database, then you must: do so only under the terms of this license or another license permitted under section 4\\.4; include a copy of this license \\(or, as applicable, a license permitted under section 4\\.4\\) or its uniform resource identifier \\(uri\\) with the database or derivative database, including both in the database or derivative database and in any relevant documentation; and keep intact any copyright or database right notices and notices that refer to this license\\. if it is not possible to put the required notices in a particular file due to its structure, then you must include the notices in a location \\(such as a relevant directory\\) where users would be likely to look for it\\. 4\\.3 notice for using output \\(contents\\)\\. creating and using a produced work does not require the notice in section 4\\.2\\. however, if you publicly use a produced work, you must include a notice associated with the produced work reasonably calculated to make any person that uses, views, accesses, interacts with, or is otherwise exposed to the produced work aware that content was obtained from the database, derivative database, or the database as part of a collective database, and that it is available under this license\\. example notice\\. the following text will satisfy notice under section 4\\.3: contains information from database name, which is

you license the derivative database under one of the licenses mentioned in \\(iii\\), you must comply with the terms of that license\\. for the avoidance of doubt, extraction or re\\-utilization of the whole or a substantial part of the contents into a new database is a derivative database and must comply with section 4\\.4\\. derivative databases and produced works\\. a derivative database is

license if you incorporate this database or a derivative database in the collection, but this license still applies to this database or a derivative database as a part of the collective database; using this database, a derivative database, or this database as part of a collective database to create a produced work does not create a derivative database for purposes of section 4\\.4; and use of a derivative database internally within an organization is not to the public and therefore does not fall under the requirements of section 4\\.4\\. 4\\.6 access to derivative databases\\. if you publicly use a derivative database or a produced work from a derivative database, you must also offer to recipients of the derivative database or produced work a copy in a machine readable form of:

a medium that does not alter or restrict the terms of this license, or any rights granted under it, or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights \\(an \"unrestricted database\"\\); and the unrestricted database is at least as accessible to the recipient as a practical matter as the restricted database\\. for the avoidance of doubt, you may place

license or any rights granted under it or have the effect or intent of restricting the ability of any person to exercise those rights\\. 4\\.8 licensing of others\\. you may not sublicense the database\\. each time you communicate the database, the whole or substantial part of the contents, or any derivative database to anyone else in any way, the licensor offers to the recipient a license to the database on the same terms and conditions as this license\\. you are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this license, but you may enforce any rights that you have over a derivative database\\. you are solely responsible for any modifications of a derivative database made by you or another person at your direction\\. you may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this license\\. 5\\.0 moral rights 5\\.1 moral rights\\. this section covers moral rights, including any rights to be identified as the author

licensor waives all moral rights that licensor may have in the database to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under section 10\\.4; if waiver of moral rights under section 5\\.1 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible, licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the database and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under section 10\\.4; and for jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under section 5\\.1 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over certain aspects of the database\\. please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the database in some jurisdictions\\. 6\\.0 fair dealing, database exceptions, and other rights not affected 6\\.1 this license does not affect any rights that you or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this database, including without limitation: exceptions to the database right including: extraction of contents from non\\-electronic databases for private purposes, extraction for purposes of illustration for teaching or scientific research, and extraction or re\\-utilization for public security or an administrative or judicial procedure\\. fair dealing, fair use, or any other legally recognized limitation or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws\\. 6\\.2 this license does not affect any rights of lawful users to extract and re\\-utilise insubstantial parts of the contents, evaluated quantitatively or qualitatively, for any purposes whatsoever, including creating a derivative database \\(subject to other rights over the contents, see section 2\\.4\\)\\. the repeated and systematic extraction or re\\-utilization of insubstantial parts of the contents may however amount to the extraction or re\\-utilization of a substantial part of the contents\\. 7\\.0 warranties and disclaimer 7\\.1 the database is licensed by the licensor \"as is\" and without any warranty of any kind, either express, implied, or arising by statute, custom, course of dealing, or trade usage\\. licensor specifically disclaims any and all implied warranties or conditions of title, non\\-infringement, accuracy or completeness, the presence or absence of errors, fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or otherwise\\. some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to you\\. 8\\.0 limitation of liability 8\\.1 subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the licensor is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this license, whether by you or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the licensor or not\\. this exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages such as loss of revenue, data, anticipated profits, and lost business\\. this exclusion applies even if the licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\. 8\\.2 if liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the licensor\\. 9\\.0 termination of your rights under this license 9\\.1 any breach by you of the terms and conditions of this license automatically terminates this license with immediate effect and without notice to you\\. for the avoidance of doubt, persons who have received the database, the whole or a substantial part of the contents, derivative databases, or the database as part of a collective database from you under this license will not have their licenses terminated provided their use is in full compliance with this license or a license granted under section 4\\.8 of this license\\. sections 1, 2, 7, 8, 9 and 10 will survive any termination of this license\\. 9\\.2 if you are not in breach of the terms of this license, the licensor will not terminate your rights under it\\. 9\\.3 unless terminated under section 9\\.1, this license is granted to you for the duration of applicable rights in the database\\. 9\\.4 reinstatement of rights\\. if you cease any breach of the terms and conditions of this license, then your full rights under this license will be reinstated: provisionally and subject to permanent termination until the 60th day after cessation of breach; permanently on the 60th day after cessation of breach unless otherwise reasonably notified by the licensor; or permanently if reasonably notified by the licensor of the violation, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this license from the licensor, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice\\. persons subject to permanent termination of rights are not eligible to be a recipient and receive a license under section 4\\.8\\. 9\\.5 notwithstanding the above, licensor reserves the right to release the database under different license terms or to stop distributing or making available the database\\. releasing the database under different license terms or stopping the distribution of the database will not withdraw this license \\(or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this license\\), and this license will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above\\. 10\\.0 general 10\\.1 if any provision of this license is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms and conditions of this license and each remaining provision of this license shall be valid and enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law\\. 10\\.2

1.0","identifier":"PDDL-1.0","url":["http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1.0/"],"header":"","template":"open data commons \\- public domain dedication & license \\(pddl\\) preamble the open data commons \\- public domain dedication & license is a document intended to allow you to freely share, modify, and use this work for any purpose and without any restrictions\\. this license is intended for use on databases or their contents \\(\"data\"\\), either together or individually\\. many databases are covered by copyright \\. some jurisdictions, mainly in europe, have specific special rights that cover databases called the \"sui generis\" database right\\. both of these sets of rights, as well as other legal rights used to protect databases and data, can create uncertainty or practical difficulty for those wishing to share databases and their underlying data but retain a limited amount of rights under a \"some rights reserved\" approach to licensing as outlined in the science commons protocol for implementing open access data\\. as a result, this waiver and license tries to the fullest extent possible to eliminate or fully license any rights that cover this database and data\\. any community norms or similar statements of use of the database or data do not form a part of this document, and do not act as a contract for access or other terms of use for the database or data\\. the position of the recipient of the work because this document places the database and its contents in or as close as possible within the public domain, there are no restrictions or requirements placed on the recipient by this document\\. recipients may use this work commercially, use technical protection measures, combine this data or database with other databases or data, and share their changes and additions or keep them secret\\. it is not a requirement that recipients provide further users with a copy of this license or attribute the original creator of the data or database as a source\\. the goal is to eliminate restrictions held by the original creator of the data and database on the use of it by others\\. the position of the dedicator of the work copyright law, as with most other law under the banner of \"intellectual property\", is inherently national law\\. this means that there exists several differences in how copyright and other ip rights can be relinquished, waived or licensed in the many legal jurisdictions of the world\\. this is despite much harmonisation of minimum levels of protection\\. the internet and other communication technologies span these many disparate legal jurisdictions and thus pose special difficulties for a document relinquishing and waiving intellectual property rights, including copyright and database rights, for use by the global community\\. because of this feature of intellectual property law, this document first relinquishes the rights and waives the relevant rights and claims\\. it then goes on to license these same rights for jurisdictions or areas of law that may make it difficult to relinquish or waive rights or claims\\. the purpose of this document is to enable rightsholders to place their work into the public domain\\. unlike licenses for free and open source software, free cultural works, or open content licenses, rightsholders will not be able to \"dual license\" their work by releasing the same work under different licenses\\. this is because they have allowed anyone to use the work in whatever way they choose\\. rightsholders therefore can\"t re\\-license it under copyright or database rights on different terms because they have nothing left to license\\. doing so creates truly accessible data to build rich applications and advance the progress of science and the arts\\. this document can cover either or both of the database and its contents \\(the data\\)\\. because databases can have a wide variety of content \\- not just factual data \\- rightsholders should use the open data commons \\- public domain dedication & license for an entire database and its contents only if everything can be placed under the terms of this document\\. because even factual data can sometimes have intellectual property rights, rightsholders should use this license to cover both the database and its factual data when making material available under this document; even if it is likely that the data would not be covered by copyright or database rights\\. rightsholders can also use this document to cover any copyright or database rights claims over only a database, and leave the contents to be covered by other licenses or documents\\. they can do this because this document refers to the \"work\", which can be either \\- or both \\- the database and its contents\\. as a result, rightsholders need to clearly state what they are dedicating under this document when they dedicate it\\. just like any license or other document dealing with intellectual property, rightsholders should be aware that one can only license what one owns\\. please ensure that the rights have been cleared to make this material available under this document\\. this document permanently and irrevocably makes the work available to the public for any use of any kind, and it should not be used unless the rightsholder is prepared for this to happen\\. part i: introduction the rightsholder \\(the person holding rights or claims over the work\\) agrees as follows: 1\\.0 definitions of capitalised words \" copyright \" \\- includes rights under copyright and under neighbouring rights and similarly related sets of rights under the law of the relevant jurisdiction under section 6\\.4\\. \"data\" \\- the contents of the database, which includes the information, independent works, or other material collected into the database offered under the terms of this document\\. \"database\" \\- a collection of data arranged in a systematic or methodical way and individually accessible by electronic or other means offered under the terms of this document\\. \"database right\" \\- means rights over data resulting from the chapter iii \\(\"sui generis\"\\) rights in the database directive \\(directive 96\\/9\\/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 11 march 1996 on the legal protection of databases\\) and any future updates as well as any similar rights available in the relevant jurisdiction under section 6\\.4\\. \"document\" \\- means this relinquishment and waiver of rights and claims and back up license agreement\\. \"person\" \\- means a natural or legal person or a body of persons corporate or incorporate\\. \"use\" \\- as a verb, means doing any act that is restricted by copyright or database rights whether in the original medium or any other; and includes modifying the work as may be technically necessary to use it in a different mode or format\\. this includes the right to sublicense the work\\. \"work\" \\- means either or both of the database and data offered under the terms of this document\\. \"you\" \\- the person acquiring rights under the license elements of this document\\. words in the singular include the plural and vice versa\\. 2\\.0 what this document covers 2\\.1\\. legal effect of this document\\. this document is: a dedication to the public domain and waiver of copyright and database rights over the work; and a license of copyright and database rights over the work in jurisdictions that do not allow for relinquishment or waiver\\. 2\\.2\\. legal rights covered\\. copyright \\. any copyright or neighbouring rights in the work\\. copyright law varies between jurisdictions, but is likely to cover: the database model or schema, which is the structure, arrangement, and organization of the database, and can also include the database tables and table indexes; the data entry and output sheets; and the field names of data stored in the database\\. copyright may also cover the data depending on the jurisdiction and type of data; and database rights\\. database rights only extend to the extraction and re\\-utilization of the whole or a substantial part of the data\\. database rights can apply even when there is no copyright over the database\\. database rights can also apply when the data is removed from the database and is selected and arranged in a way that would not infringe any applicable copyright \\. 2\\.2 rights not covered\\. this document does not apply to computer programs used in the making or operation of the database; this document does not cover any patents over the data or the database\\. please see section 4\\.2 later in this document for further details; and this document does not cover any trade marks associated with the database\\. please see section 4\\.3 later in this document for further details\\. users of this database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licenses\\. 2\\.3 facts are free\\. the rightsholder takes the position that factual information is not covered by copyright \\. this document however covers the work in jurisdictions that may protect the factual information in the work by copyright , and to cover any information protected by copyright that is contained in the work\\. part ii: dedication to the public domain 3\\.0 dedication, waiver, and license of copyright and database rights 3\\.1 dedication of copyright and database rights to the public domain\\. the rightsholder by using this document, dedicates the work to the public domain for the benefit of the public and relinquishes all rights in copyright and database rights over the work\\. the rightsholder realizes that once these rights are relinquished, that the rightsholder has no further rights in copyright and database rights over the work, and that the work is free and open for others to use\\. the rightsholder intends for their relinquishment to cover all present and future rights in the work under copyright and database rights, whether they are vested or contingent rights, and that this relinquishment of rights covers all their heirs and successors\\. the above relinquishment of rights applies worldwide and includes media and formats now known or created in the future\\. 3\\.2 waiver of rights and claims in copyright and database rights when section 3\\.1 dedication inapplicable\\. if the dedication in section 3\\.1 does not apply in the relevant jurisdiction under section 6\\.4, the rightsholder waives any rights and claims that the rightsholder may have or acquire in the future over the work in: copyright ; and database rights\\. to the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, the above waiver of rights and claims applies worldwide and includes media and formats now known or created in the future\\. the rightsholder agrees not to assert the above rights and waives the right to enforce them over the work\\. 3\\.3 license of copyright and database rights when sections 3\\.1 and 3\\.2 inapplicable\\. if the dedication and waiver in sections 3\\.1 and 3\\.2 does not apply in the relevant jurisdiction under section 6\\.4, the rightsholder and you agree as follows: the licensor grants to you a worldwide, royalty\\-free, non\\-exclusive, license to use the work for the duration of any applicable copyright and database rights\\. these rights explicitly include commercial use, and do not exclude any field of endeavour\\. to the extent possible in the relevant jurisdiction, these rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or created in the future\\. 3\\.4 moral rights\\. this section covers moral rights, including the right to be identified as the author of the work or to object to treatment that would otherwise prejudice the author\"s honour and reputation, or any other derogatory treatment: for jurisdictions allowing waiver of moral rights, licensor waives all moral rights that licensor may have in the work to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under section 6\\.4; if waiver of moral rights under section 3\\.4 a in the relevant jurisdiction is not possible, licensor agrees not to assert any moral rights over the work and waives all claims in moral rights to the fullest extent possible by the law of the relevant jurisdiction under section 6\\.4; and for jurisdictions not allowing waiver or an agreement not to assert moral rights under section 3\\.4 a and b, the author may retain their moral rights over the copyright ed aspects of the work\\. please note that some jurisdictions do not allow for the waiver of moral rights, and so moral rights may still subsist over the work in some jurisdictions\\. 4\\.0 relationship to other rights 4\\.1 no other contractual conditions\\. the rightsholder makes this work available to you without any other contractual obligations, either express or implied\\. any community norms statement associated with the work is not a contract and does not form part of this document\\. 4\\.2 relationship to patents\\. this document does not grant you a license for any patents that the rightsholder may own\\. users of this database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licenses\\. 4\\.3 relationship to trade marks\\. this document does not grant you a license for any trade marks that the rightsholder may own or that the rightsholder may use to cover the work\\. users of this database are cautioned that they may have to clear other rights or consult other licenses\\. part iii: general provisions 5\\.0 warranties, disclaimer, and limitation of liability 5\\.1 the work is provided by the rightsholder \"as is\" and without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied, whether of title, of accuracy or completeness, of the presence of absence of errors, of fitness for purpose, or otherwise\\. some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so this exclusion may not apply to you\\. 5\\.2 subject to any liability that may not be excluded or limited by law, the rightsholder is not liable for, and expressly excludes, all liability for loss or damage however and whenever caused to anyone by any use under this document, whether by you or by anyone else, and whether caused by any fault on the part of the rightsholder or not\\. this exclusion of liability includes, but is not limited to, any special, incidental, consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages\\. this exclusion applies even if the rightsholder has been advised of the possibility of such damages\\. 5\\.3 if liability may not be excluded by law, it is limited to actual and direct financial loss to the extent it is caused by proved negligence on the part of the rightsholder\\. 6\\.0 general 6\\.1 if any provision of this document is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that must not affect the cvalidity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this document\\. 6\\.2 this document is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the work covered here\\. it replaces any earlier understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the work not specified here\\. 6\\.3 this document does not affect any rights that you or anyone else may independently have under any applicable law to make any use of this work, including \\(for jurisdictions where this document is a license\\) fair dealing, fair use, database exceptions, or any other legally recognized limitation or exception to infringement of copyright or other applicable laws\\. 6\\.4 this document takes effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the document terms are sought to be enforced\\. if the rights waived or granted under applicable law in the relevant jurisdiction includes additional rights not waived or granted under this document, these additional rights are included in this document in order to meet the intent of this document\\.","hasMarkup":false},{"name":"Open Group Test Suite

accessed or used by anyone other than you, used to provide any services to anyone other than you, or used in any way to deliver any content to anyone other than you, whether the covered code is distributed to those parties, made available as an application intended for use over a computer network, or used to provide services or otherwise deliver content to anyone other than you\\. 1\\.8\\. \"interface\" means interfaces, functions, properties, class definitions, apis, header files, guids, v\\-tables, and\\/or protocols allowing one piece of software, firmware or hardware to communicate or interoperate with another piece of software, firmware or hardware\\. 1\\.9 \"modifications\" mean any addition to, deletion from, and\\/or change to, the substance and\\/or structure of the original code, any previous modifications, the combination of original code and any previous modifications, and\\/or any respective portions thereof\\. when code is released as a series of files, a

to the terms and conditions of this license, licensor hereby grants you, effective on the date you accept this license \\(via downloading or using covered code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this license\\), a worldwide, royalty\\-free, non\\-exclusive copyright license, to the extent of licensor\"s copyright s cover the original code, to do the following: 2\\.1 you may reproduce, display, perform, modify and deploy covered code, provided that in each instance: you must retain and reproduce in all copies of original code the copyright and other proprietary notices and disclaimers of licensor as they appear in the original code, and keep intact all notices in the original code that refer to this license; you must include a copy of this license with every copy of source code of covered code and documentation you distribute, and you may not offer or impose any terms on such source code that alter or restrict this license or the recipients\" rights hereunder, except as permitted under section 6; you must duplicate, to the extent it does not already exist, the notice in exhibit a in each file of the source code of all your modifications, and cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change; you must make source code of all your externally deployed modifications publicly available under the terms of this license, including the license grants set forth in section 3 below, for as long as you deploy the covered code or twelve \\(12\\) months from the date of initial deployment, whichever is longer\\. you should preferably distribute the source code of your deployed modifications electronically \\(e\\.g\\. download from a web site\\); and if you deploy covered code in object code, executable form only, you must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in related documentation, stating that source code of the covered code is available under the terms of this license with information on how and where to obtain such source code\\. you must also include the object code notice set forth in exhibit a in the \"about\" box or other appropriate place where other copyright notices are placed, including any packaging materials\\. 2\\.2 you expressly acknowledge and agree that although licensor and each contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of the covered code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by licensor or any contributor that the covered code does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity\\. licensor and each contributor disclaim any liability to you for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise\\. as a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, you hereby assume sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any\\. for example, if a third party patent license is required to allow you to make, use, sell, import or offer for sale the covered code, it is your responsibility to acquire such license\\(s\\)\\. 2\\.3 subject to the terms and conditions of this license, licensor hereby grants you, effective on the date you accept this license \\(via downloading or using covered code or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this license\\), a worldwide, royalty\\-free, perpetual, non\\-exclusive patent license under licensor\"s applicable patent rights to make, use, sell, offer for sale and import the covered code, provided that in each instance you comply with the terms of this license\\. your grants\\. in consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses granted to you under this license: you grant to licensor and all third parties a non\\-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free license under your applicable patent rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by you, to make, sell, offer for sale, use, import, reproduce, display, perform, modify, distribute and deploy your modifications of the same scope and extent as licensor\"s licenses under sections 2\\.1 and 2\\.2; and you grant to licensor and its subsidiaries a non\\-exclusive, worldwide, royalty\\-free, perpetual and irrevocable license, under your applicable patent rights and other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by you, to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, reproduce, display, perform, distribute, modify or have modified \\(for licensor and\\/or its subsidiaries\\), sublicense and distribute your modifications, in any form and for any purpose, through multiple tiers of distribution\\. you agree not use any information derived from your use and review of the covered code, including but not limited to any algorithms or inventions that may be contained in the covered code, for the purpose of asserting any of your patent rights, or assisting a third party to assert any of its patent rights, against licensor or any contributor\\. derivative works\\. you may create a derivative work by combining covered code with other code not otherwise governed by the terms of this license and distribute the derivative work as an integrated product\\. in each such instance, you must make sure the requirements of this license are fulfillled for the covered code or any portion thereof, including all modifications\\. 4\\.1 you must cause any derivative work that you distribute, publish or externally deploy, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the covered code or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this license and no other license except as provided in section 4\\.2\\. you also must make source code available for the derivative work under the same terms as modifications, described in sections 2 and 3, above\\. 4\\.2 compatible source licenses\\. software modules that have been independently developed without any use of covered code and which contain no portion of the covered code, modifications or other derivative works, but are used or combined in any way with the covered code or any derivative work to form a larger derivative work, are exempt from the conditions described in section 4\\.1 but only to the extent that: the software module, including any software that is linked to, integrated with, or part of the same applications as, the software module by any method must be wholly subject to one of the compatible source licenses\\. notwithstanding the foregoing, all covered code must be subject to the terms of this license\\. thus, the entire derivative work must be licensed under a combination of the rpsl \\(for covered code\\) and a compatible source license for any independently developed software modules within the derivative work\\. the foregoing requirement applies even if the compatible source license would ordinarily allow the software module to link with, or form larger works with, other software that is not subject to the compatible source license\\. for example, although the mozilla public license v1\\.1 allows mozilla code to be combined with proprietary software that is not subject to the mpl, if mpl\\-licensed code is used with covered code the mpl\\-licensed code could not be combined or linked with any code not governed by the mpl\\. the general intent of this section 4\\.2 is to enable use of covered code with applications that are wholly subject to an acceptable open source license\\. you are responsible for determining whether your use of software with covered code is allowed under your license to such software\\. 4\\.3 mere aggregation of another work not based on the covered code with the covered code \\(or with a work based on the covered code\\) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this license\\. if you deliver the covered code for combination and\\/or integration with an application previously provided by you \\(for example, via automatic updating technology\\), such combination and\\/or integration constitutes a derivative work subject to the terms of this license\\. exclusions from license grant\\. nothing in this license shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyright s, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of licensor or any contributor except as expressly stated herein\\. no right is granted to the trademarks of licensor or any contributor even if such marks are included in the covered code\\. nothing in this license shall be interpreted to prohibit licensor from licensing under different terms from this license any code that licensor otherwise would have a right to license\\. modifications, derivative works and\\/or any use or combination of covered code with other technology provided by licensor or third parties may require additional patent licenses from licensor which licensor may grant in its sole discretion\\. no patent license is granted separate from the original code or combinations of the original code with other software or hardware\\. 5\\.1\\. trademarks\\. this license does not grant any rights to use the trademarks or trade names owned by licensor \\(\"licensor marks\" defined in exhibit c\\) or to any trademark or trade name belonging to any contributor\\. no licensor marks may be used to endorse or promote products derived from the original code other than as permitted by the licensor trademark policy defined in exhibit c\\. additional terms\\. you may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and\\/or other rights consistent with the scope of the license granted herein \\(\"additional terms\"\\) to one or more recipients of covered code\\. however, you may do so only on your own behalf and as your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of licensor or any contributor\\. you must obtain the recipient\"s agreement that any such additional terms are offered by you alone, and you hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold licensor and every contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or claims asserted against licensor or such contributor by reason of any such additional terms\\. versions of the license\\. licensor may publish revised and\\/or new versions of this license from time to time\\. each version will be given a distinguishing version number\\. once original code has been published under a particular version of this license, you may continue to use it under the terms of that version\\. you may also choose to use such original code under the terms of any subsequent version of this license published by licensor\\. no one other than licensor has the right to modify the terms applicable to covered code created under this license\\. no warranty or support\\. the covered code may contain in whole or in part pre\\-release, untested, or not fully tested works\\. the covered code may contain errors that could cause failures or loss of data, and may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies\\. you expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the covered code, or any portion thereof, is at your sole and entire risk\\. the covered code is provided \"as is\" and without warranty, upgrades or support of any kind and licensor and licensor\"s licensor\\(s\\) \\(collectively referred to as \"licensor\" for the purposes of sections 8 and 9\\) and all contributors expressly disclaim all warranties and\\/or conditions, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties and\\/or conditions of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, of fitness for a particular purpose, of accuracy, of quiet enjoyment, and noninfringement of third party rights\\. licensor and each contributor does not warrant against interference with your enjoyment of the covered code, that the functions contained in the covered code will meet your requirements, that the operation of the covered code will be uninterrupted or error\\-free, or that defects in the covered code will be corrected\\. no oral or written documentation, information or advice given by licensor, a licensor authorized representative or any contributor shall create a warranty\\. you acknowledge that the covered code is not intended for use in high risk activities, including, but not limited to, the design, construction, operation or maintenance of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation, aircraft communication systems, or air traffic control machines in which case the failure of the covered code could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage\\. licensor disclaims any express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses\\. limitation of liability\\. to the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall licensor or any contributor be liable for any incidental, special, indirect or consequential damages arising out of or relating to this license or your use or inability to use the covered code, or any portion thereof, whether under a theory of contract, warranty, tort \\(including negligence or strict liability\\), products liability or otherwise, even if licensor or such contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages and notwithstanding the failure of essential purpose of any remedy\\. some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability of incidental or consequential damages, so this limitation may not apply to you\\. in no event shall licensor\"s total liability to you for all damages \\(other than as may be required by applicable law\\) under this license exceed the amount of ten dollars \\(\\$10\\.00\\)\\. ownership\\. subject to the licenses granted under this license, each contributor retains all rights, title and interest in and to any modifications made by such contributor\\. licensor retains all rights, title and interest in and to the original code and any modifications made by or on behalf of licensor \\(\"licensor modifications\"\\), and such licensor modifications will not be automatically subject to this license\\. licensor may, at its sole discretion, choose to license such licensor modifications under this license, or on different terms from those contained in this license or may choose not to license them at all\\. termination\\. 11\\.1 term and termination\\. the term of this license is perpetual unless terminated as provided below\\. this license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate: automatically without notice from licensor if you fail to comply with any term\\(s\\) of this license and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of such breach; immediately in the event of the circumstances described in section 12\\.5\\(b\\); or automatically without notice from licensor if you, at any time during the term of this license, commence an action for patent infringement against licensor \\(including by cross\\-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit\\); upon written notice from licensor if you, at any time during the term of this license, commence an action for patent infringement against any third party alleging that the covered code itself \\(excluding combinations with other software or hardware\\) infringes any patent \\(including by cross\\-claim or counter claim in a lawsuit\\)\\. 11\\.2 effect of termination\\. upon termination, you agree to immediately stop any further use, reproduction, modification, sublicensing and distribution of the covered code and to destroy all copies of the covered code that are in your possession or control\\. all sublicenses to the covered code which have been properly granted prior to termination shall survive any termination of this license\\. provisions which, by their nature, should remain in effect beyond the termination of this license shall survive, including but not limited to sections 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\.2 and 13\\. no party will be liable to any other for compensation, indemnity or damages of any sort solely as a result of terminating this license in accordance with its terms, and termination of this license will be without prejudice to any other right or remedy of any party\\. miscellaneous\\. 12\\.1 government end users\\. the covered code is a \"commercial item\" as defined in far 2\\.101\\. government software and technical data rights in the covered code include only those rights customarily provided to the public as defined in this license\\. this customary commercial license in technical data and software is provided in accordance with far 12\\.211 \\(technical data\\) and 12\\.212 \\(computer software\\) and, for department of

open source software and derive financial benefit from it without having to release their improvements or derivatives to the community which enabled them\\. this occurred any time an entity did not release their application to a \"third party\"\\. while there is a certain freedom in this model of licensing, it struck the authors of the rpl as being unfair to the open source community at large and to the original authors of the works in particular\\. after all, bug fixes, extensions, and meaningful and valuable derivatives were not consistently finding their way back into the community where they could fuel further, and faster, growth and expansion of the overall open source software base\\. while you should clearly read and understand the entire license, the essence of the rpl is found in two definitions: \"deploy\" and \"required components\"\\. regarding deployment, under the rpl your changes, bug fixes, extensions, etc\\. must be made available to the open source community at large when you deploy in any form \\-\\- either internally or to an outside party\\. once you start running the software you have to start sharing the software\\. further, under the rpl all components you author including schemas, scripts, source code, etc\\. \\-\\- regardless of whether they\"re compiled into a single binary or used as two halves of client\\/server application \\-\\- must be shared\\. you have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it\\. in addition to these goals, the rpl was authored to meet the requirements of the open source definition as maintained by the open source initiative \\(osi\\)\\. the specific terms and conditions of the license are defined in the remainder of this document\\. license terms 1\\.0 general; applicability & definitions\\.
